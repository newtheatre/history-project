# <i class="octicon octicon-git-pull-request"></i> {{ page.title }}

This project relies on help from the alumni community. If you see a show missing information, a committee record a few names short or just have an interesting story to tell you can help out in a number of ways.

## Contacting us <span class="headerlite">- best for large contributions</span>

Please email us at <{{site.email}}> if you have something to contribute. In particular we are looking for: listings of season shows, casts and crew lists, photographs, programmes, flyers, reviews and anything else which could provide an insight into the history of the theatre.

Don't worry if you aren't quite ready to part with your cherished New Theatre relics just yet â€“ the University Archives have offered to photograph and document any items sent to them, and then return them safely to you for safe keeping!

## Report problems with individual pages <span class="headerlite">- best for small additions</span>

We use an issue tracker to maintain a list of jobs to do. If you spot a misspelled name, a terrible typo or can help us fill in some blanks you can add to this by reporting problems with pages.

Click the <strong class="tag"><i class="octicon octicon-issue-opened"></i> Report This Page</strong> button on the right when on the page you want to tell us about and complete a report.

Please keep in mind all reports are public. You can see [all reports made using this tool here](https://github.com/newtheatre/history-project/issues?q=label%3Areport-tool+).
