# <i class="octicon octicon-git-pull-request"></i> {{ page.title }}

This project relies on contributions from the alumni community. If you see a show missing information, a committee record a few names short or just have an interesting story to tell you can help out in a number of ways.

## Contacting us

Please email us at <{{site.email}}> if you have something to contribute, and don’t worry if you aren’t quite ready to part with your cherished New Theatre relics just yet – the University Archives have offered to photgraph and document any items sent to them, and then return them safely to you for safe keeping!

## Report problems with pages

We use an issue tracker to maintain a list of jobs to do. If you spot a misspelled name, a terrible typo or can help us fill in some blanks you can add to this by reporting problems with pages.

Click the <strong><i class="octicon octicon-issue-opened"></i> Report This Page</strong> button on the right when on the page you want to tell us about and complete a report.

Please keep in mind all reports are public. You can see [all reports made using this tool here](https://github.com/newtheatre/history-project/issues?q=label%3Areport-tool+).
