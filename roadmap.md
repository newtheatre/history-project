- [**Mid May**](https://github.com/newtheatre/history-project/milestones/alpha-2): Add a number of shows, polish the styling, make sure the site is working well on mobile devices, optimise search, add bios.
- [**End of May**](https://github.com/newtheatre/history-project/milestones/launch): Have all the shows we have on record entered into the site. Officially launch.
