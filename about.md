The Alumni Network was founded in order to build a stronger sense of the history of the theatre, and with the launch of “The New Theatre History Project” we are hoping to do just that!

Following recent meetings with the staff at the Nottingham University Archives we are starting this project to piece together the many different aspects and parts of the New Theatre’s dynamic and vibrant history.

We intend to document everything online, and we are hoping to send this project live before Christmas so check back here in the near future to see how we are getting on!

> "whether you were an actor, a director, a stage-manager or an audience member, we want you to get in touch with you memories from the New Theatre"

This is an extremely exciting project for the Alumni Network, and we are relying on as many people as possible getting involved and contributing to the story – whether you were an actor, a director, a stage-manager or an audience member, we want you to get in touch with you memories from your time at the New Theatre.

In particular we are looking for: listings of season shows, casts and crew lists, photographs, programmes, flyers, reviews and anything else which could provide an insight into the history of the theatre.

Please email us at alumni@newtheatre.org.uk if you have something to contribute, and don’t worry if you aren’t quite ready to part with your cherished New Theatre relics just yet – the University Archives have offered to photgraph and document any items sent to them, and then return them safely to you for safe keeping!
