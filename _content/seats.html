seats

blurb:
  - In the November of 2013, The New Theatre welcomed
  Matthew Bannister, Nottingham Alumni and BBC Broadcaster
  to launch our seat sponsoring appeal. The Seat Naming project
  was part of a wider Impact Campaign centred around the building,
  which included the refurbishment of the seating in the main auditorium,
  the construction of our two studio spaces and a much needed investment
  in lighting and sound equipment. All these refurbishments and upgrades
  were funded by the Students' Union and donations from Alumni.

  Matthew Bannister was heavily involved in the campaigning for the
  seating and staging. His speech at the launch of the appeal on
  16th November 2013 marks the beginning of an appeal that allows
  alumni to sponsor one of the seats in our main auditorium with
  a personalised plaque. Any money donated through the appeal will be
  put towards the continuing updating of the Lighting, Sound and 
  Communications equipment within the building. As well as this,
  funds will also contribute towards sending students from the Theatre
  up to the Edinburgh Fringe festival each year.
