If you have photographs or other media relating to past shows or activities of the theatre we would love to get a hold of them. If your items are physical please [see the contributing page](/contributing/), if not read on.

For inclusion on your alumni biography. Please ensure your upload has a filename so we can identify you, such as `firstname_lastname.jpg`.

Please let us know you're going to upload by sending a message using the <strong class="tag"><i class="ion-chatbox-working"></i> Message the Editors</strong> button on the page the images pertain to. Files should have sensible filenames so we know which show they go with.
