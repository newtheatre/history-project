github-issues-widget
====================

Got a public GitHub repository? Got some open issues in its GitHub-brand issue tracker? Got a web site? Want to display those issues on that web site? Then this widget might be useful to you.

It requires jQuery (tested with version 1.6.2).

Open demo.html for a demo.
