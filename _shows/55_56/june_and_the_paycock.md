Juno and the Paycock is a play by Sean O'Casey, and one of the most highly regarded and often performed plays in Ireland. It was first staged at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin in 1924. It is set in the working class tenements of Dublin in the early 1920s, during the Irish Civil War period.

It is the second of his well known "Dublin Trilogy" â€“ the other two being The Shadow of a Gunman (1923) and The Plough and the Stars (1926).
