The End of the Beginning is a 1937 one-act play by Sean O'Casey.

It is a comedy set in rural Ireland. A couple argue about whether men's or women's work is more difficult, and swap places. At one point the husband and his friend practise their song which they are about to perform at a show: Down Where the Bees are Humming. There is also some comic business with the cow attached to a rope, passed down the chimney and attached to a chair.

The cast of only three (the couple plus the husband's friend) makes it suitable for some purposes e.g. entries in drama festivals.
