    publisher: Nottingham Journal
    quote: "Gamini Salgado's production was a little slow at times and the general attack of the whole cast was not positive enough. The original music for the production, by Herbert Murrill, was arranged and the incidental music was composed and played by one of the students, Bernard Astill."
