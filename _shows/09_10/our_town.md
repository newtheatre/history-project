    quote: "With some challenges still to overcome in the piece, it was enjoyable to watch with subtle nuances throughout that created the strong moral message of Carpe diem (seize the day), leaving the audience with an enriched insight into the lives of ordinary people whose hopes and dreams flicker throughout the passage of time."

Our Town is Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer-prizewinning classic. The story follows George Gibbs and Emlly Webb from their first romance, to marriage and ultimately to Emily's death in childbirth.
