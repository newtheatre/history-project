===== Synopsis =====

Ghetto - "Everytime we put on a show - sold out three weeks in advance!... People who knew next day they'd be on a train to the camps, the night before they'd put on their finery and come to a play."

Set in the Lithuanian Ghetto of Vilna in 1942, Ghetto tells the real story of a small community of Jewish artists who find each other in the midst of mass deprivation and suffering. They resolve to create plays, music and concerts with the hope of putting as many people as possible to work in order to survive.
