The table is laid and an artist, a scientist and a sexpot are dressing for dinner. Paige, hostess extraordinaire, is famed as much for her acid tongue as her inventive menus but tonight, in celebrating the publication of her husband's first book, she will go far beyond belief.

You are all invited to Dinner, a satirical comedy about the middle classes.
