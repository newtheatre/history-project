Richard, a Doctor with a history of drug problems, has moved his wife Corinne and their children to the countryside with promises of a fresh start.

But who is the comatose woman he has found late at night, alone on the roadside, and why has he brought her into his house?

‘The Country’ is a beautifully written dissection of sexual politics, deception and despair by one of Britain’s most exciting modern playwrights
