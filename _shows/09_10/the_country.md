    quote: "This being said, I left the theatre feeling satisfied, with little desire to do anything but talk about this play, and yet unable to find words in which to frame my thoughts. Stunned would not be an overstatement. This is a play that you most certainly should not miss."

Richard, a Doctor with a history of drug problems, has moved his wife Corinne and their children to the countryside with promises of a fresh start.

But who is the comatose woman he has found late at night, alone on the roadside, and why has he brought her into his house?

‘The Country’ is a beautifully written dissection of sexual politics, deception and despair by one of Britain’s most exciting modern playwrights
