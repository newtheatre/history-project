    quote: "Overall, Excess should be commended for its courageousness in confronting some of the biggest mores of todayâ€™s society with honesty and compassion, and marks as such the end of another brilliant season at the New Theatre. And if you need more convincing, there is an almost gratuitous amount of semi-nudity."

A tango bar. A bedroom.

A young couple. A rent boy.

Two best mates. A predator.

A shy barmaid. A guy who listens.

As these stories intersect and unravel we find startling parallels with our own lives.
