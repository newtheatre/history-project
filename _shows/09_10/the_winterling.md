    quote: "This play is certainly a must – see. Due to the New Season, you might not even have been aware that things were up and running again, but now you know, I’m sure the booking office will be overwhelmed. If ‘The Winterling’ is a good indication of things to come, this New Theatre Season is going to surpass the last! If that’s possible."

'I like London. I like pavements. I like to walk out the door and not sink up to my waist in primordial sludge. I don't like sheep. I don't like the country. It's covered in shit.'

West waits in a burnt-out farmhouse on Dartmoor in the depths of winter with two associates from the city. The wine has been poured and the revolver loaded...

A dark comedy of mysterious intentions and personal isolation.
