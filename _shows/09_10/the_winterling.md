'I like London. I like pavements. I like to walk out the door and not sink up to my waist in primordial sludge. I don't like sheep. I don't like the country. It's covered in shit.'

West waits in a burnt-out farmhouse on Dartmoor in the depths of winter with two associates from the city. The wine has been poured and the revolver loaded...

A dark comedy of mysterious intentions and personal isolation.
