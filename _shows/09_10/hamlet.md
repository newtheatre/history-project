‘Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.’ This is a play about a man who could not make up his mind, or rather, could not act upon what he knew to be true. Hamlet’s course which, set in stone by his position, is shattered by the untimely death of his father. It is a revenge tragedy that transcends its genre and explores the very core of human bonds, fear, and guilt
