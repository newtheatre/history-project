    quote: "Suffice to say, Shakespeare isn’t easy to perform, but you would never know because these guys make it look effortless. This is the last production of term, so there is no excuse- to go or not to go; there is NO question about it."

    quote: "Everything was believable, I never once thought I saw an actor on stage in this immersive and genuine production. This has been a sterling end to a sterling season of plays and amid the biting winter’s chill; I walked away from Hamlet keenly feeling the warm seep of poignancy. I can give no greater accolade than that the tragedy is still as keen today as ever it was."

‘Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.’ This is a play about a man who could not make up his mind, or rather, could not act upon what he knew to be true. Hamlet’s course which, set in stone by his position, is shattered by the untimely death of his father. It is a revenge tragedy that transcends its genre and explores the very core of human bonds, fear, and guilt
