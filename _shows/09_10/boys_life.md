Set in the late 80's, Boys' Life tracks the misadventures of three former college mates as they simultaneously pursue and refuse adulthood; and the women who are both attracted to and repelled by them along the way. Told in a series of fast-paced and bitingly funny scenes, Boys' Life digs up some uncomfortable truths as the friends 'crawl through the gutter for regular sex.'
