    quote: "It was the opening night of the new season and if the quality of production is this high already, things can only get better; this performance is only on until Saturday so you haven’t got long to make your mind up, but it shouldn’t take a second thought."

Set in the late 80's, Boys' Life tracks the misadventures of three former college mates as they simultaneously pursue and refuse adulthood; and the women who are both attracted to and repelled by them along the way. Told in a series of fast-paced and bitingly funny scenes, Boys' Life digs up some uncomfortable truths as the friends 'crawl through the gutter for regular sex.'
