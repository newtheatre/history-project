    quote: "The music, effects and acting worked well to bring this challenging script to life in an atmospheric way and the build up to the climax was powerful. It was engaging and there were certainly enough screaming females to keep anybody satisfied. Definitely one that Iâ€™d recommend going to see."

    quote: "It has so much about it that was good that was simply overshadowed tonight, literally. It is a play that is hugely atmospheric, but on its first night, almost unwatchable."

The Bacchae - Dionysus has returned to Thebes seeking revenge on his family who have denied him a place of honour as a deity. He has driven the women of Thebes into an ecstatic frenzy, sending them dancing and hunting on Mount Cithearon.
