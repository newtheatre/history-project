    quote: "I feel this production could have been more adventurous- it could have been modernised and dynamic rather than traditional and static, but this was its appeal. It was a timeless Victorian drama. Nevertheless it isn’t around for long, so make sure you catch it before Saturday!"

The importance of being Earnest - To avoid family duties, Algernon Moncrieff, a bachelor-about-town, has invented Bunbury, a sick relative who frequently calls him away. His friend, Jack Worthing, has invented a wicked brother called Ernest to disguise his own misdemeanors. When Algernon poses as Ernest in order to meet the excessively pretty Cecily, confusion takes hold. And it's not until the full significance of an ordinary black handbag is discovered that Jack is allowed to marry his beloved Gwendolen.

A trivial comedy for serious people.

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST by OSCAR WILDE

A stellar cast, an outrageous set and more witty (in the true sense of the word) banter (in the most victorian meaning of the word) than you can shake a stick at.
