===== Synopsis =====

Two houses, each perched on a mountaintop, stare at each other across a deep valley.

A man and a woman talk abut the small things – parquet floor zigzagging down corridors, brown sauce and soggy chips.

Enda Walsh’s electrifying two hander is an awesome account of brutality and unfaltering loyalty magnificently told through the inane chitchat of everyday life.
