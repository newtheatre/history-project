The New Theatre Postgraduate Project are pleased to present the perennial classic, DRACULA!

Our 3rd production is directed by Daniel Russell, who you may have seen as ‘the father’ in our previous production 'Six Characters in Search of a Play'. Daniel chose to bring Steven Dietz's adaptation of Bram Stoker's famed novel to the New Theatre boards.

You can expect to be thrilled and titillated by this passionate blood fest which touches on themes of love, death, sex, madness, and the perils of neck biting.

We suggest you bring a string of garlic for your walk home in the dark.
