    quote: "Although the New Theatre’s performance lacks the right balance between the comedic elements and Ionesco’s leading thought, it is a fascinating trip to nonsense of the reality we live in, and it is highly recommended to everyone, especially those who think that Ionesco only wanted to make us laugh."

A Rhinoceros is running amok. Stories are sweeping the town. A cat has died as a direct result.

Mr Dudard is believing the stories. Daisy saw the whole thing with her own eyes. Mr Botard is denying the whole filthy business.

And Berenger has even stopped drinking.

People are beginning to talk...
