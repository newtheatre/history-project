A Rhinoceros is running amok. Stories are sweeping the town. A cat has died as a direct result.

Mr Dudard is believing the stories. Daisy saw the whole thing with her own eyes. Mr Botard is denying the whole filthy business.

And Berenger has even stopped drinking.

People are beginning to talk...
