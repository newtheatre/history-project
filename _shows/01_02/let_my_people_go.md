This is a gospel musical based around the biblical stories of the Jewish forefathers: Moses, Jacob and Abraham.

The musical opens in the Mission Home for battered women. The head of the home, Pat Brown, is a feminist alcoholic whose unprofessional manner has drawn her to the attention of the man from the council, Mr Fletcher.

Needing a witness to testify against Miss Brown, Mr Fletcher turns to Sarah Baker, a devout Christian and wife of Neil. However, Sarah will not testify.

We also follow the story of Juliette, a young mother who escapes her abusive husband Carl to find sanctuary in the home.

The story is told in an old style with a new twist. In keeping with the advice of the forefathers of theatre, the action is commented on by a Greek choir. Only this time, they're wearing gospel robes rather than plaster masks.

The Celestial Fire Gospel Singers were founded for this production. With singers from all over the world the choir have come together to bring this musical onto the stage
