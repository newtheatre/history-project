===== Synopsis =====

This is a gospel musical based around the biblical stories of the Jewish forefathers: Moses, Jacob and Abraham. 

The musical opens in the Mission Home for battered women. The head of the home, Pat Brown, is a feminist alcoholic whose unprofessional manner has drawn her to the attention of the man from the council, Mr Fletcher. 

Needing a witness to testify against Miss Brown, Mr Fletcher turns to Sarah Baker, a devout Christian and wife of Neil. However, Sarah will not testify. 

We also follow the story of Juliette, a young mother who escapes her abusive husband Carl to find sanctuary in the home. 

The story is told in an old style with a new twist. In keeping with the advice of the forefathers of theatre, the action is commented on by a Greek choir. Only this time, they're wearing gospel robes rather than plaster masks.
