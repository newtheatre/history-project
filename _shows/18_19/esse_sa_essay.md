Aged sixteen, Skipper was raped by a woman eight years his senior. As a way of dealing with the trauma, he unconsciously suppresses the memories of what happened. Years later, he begins to unpack it all, slowly learning the fragmentary nature of memories and the danger they can pose in the present. The impact this has on his life creates a difficult question: Are some things better left buried? Or is the truth worth seeking, no matter how terrible it might be? 'Esse SA Essay' is a play about masculinity, rape, and memories. In today’s culture of sexual assault scandals, toxic masculinity, and the importance of personal image, this is a discussion that needs to be held.
