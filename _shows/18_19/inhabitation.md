    title: "BEHIND THE SCENES AT NNT: ‘INHABITATION’ BY NAT HENDERSON"

---

Morgan and Evelyn can be friends. Or are. Or were. Morgan isn’t sure anymore. They find thinking difficult at the best of times, so they write. The world is difficult and complicated. So they write. Inhabitation explores the blossom and wilt of a friendship as the days slide into years, where friends are fluctuating support networks because they need support networks themselves. Examining constructions of friendship in and outside of performance, Inhabitation is a dextrous, poetic examination of connection.
