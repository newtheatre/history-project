Morgan and Evelyn can be friends. Or are. Or were. Morgan isnâ€™t sure anymore. They find thinking difficult at the best of times, so they write. The world is difficult and complicated. So they write. Inhabitation explores the blossom and wilt of a friendship as the days slide into years, where friends are fluctuating support networks because they need support networks themselves. Examining constructions of friendship in and outside of performance, Inhabitation is a dextrous, poetic examination of connection.
