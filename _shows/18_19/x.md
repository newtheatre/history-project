Gilda and her team of scientists are stationed on a research based orbiting Pluto, with Ray the captain, Clark the communications expert, Mattie the engineer, and Cole the meteorologist. They're waiting for a communication back from Earth about when they'll be able to head home. They've been waiting for a while now. No contact with anyone else. Billions of miles from home, all by themselves. No one else except... well, Gilda doesn't believe that the girl in the dark outside is real. Everyone knows that nothing survives out here, right? Alistair McDowall's tense and psychological sci-fi/horror/thriller looks at what happens when time not only isn't on your side, but starts to unravel from beneath you.
