Meet Polly, she doesn't care what you think. All she wants is to be equal, for everyone to be equal. In a whirlwind evening of live music, spoken word, and drag tomfoolery, Polly will put across her manifesto for ending all the world's problems. Using drag and gig theatre, multi award winning performer Joe Strickland will incite a rebellion against everything that holds us back in life, initially aimed at those in power but slowly turned inward onto the walls and masks we put in front of ourselves.
