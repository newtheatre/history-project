    quote: The characters are well perceived and the play subject matter is well observed and gives you something to think about on many levels.

Hannah and Lia believe they are best friends, kindred spirits brought together by time and a similar ambition. Aspiring writers, they are both fortunate enough to be offered jobs with the same newspaper, a move which will change both of their lives – though not necessarily for the better. Glassy Ceiling, Concrete Flaw explores the mechanics of human relationships inside the machine that is a modern office, questioning whether or not ambition demands a blind focus on the self, the extent to which kindness and perceived weakness are intertwined, and if ignorance really is the ultimate sin.
