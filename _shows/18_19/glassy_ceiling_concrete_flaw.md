Hannah and Lia believe they are best friends, kindred spirits brought together by time and a similar ambition. Aspiring writers, they are both fortunate enough to be offered jobs with the same newspaper, a move which will change both of their lives â€“ though not necessarily for the better. Glassy Ceiling, Concrete Flaw explores the mechanics of human relationships inside the machine that is a modern office, questioning whether or not ambition demands a blind focus on the self, the extent to which kindness and perceived weakness are intertwined, and if ignorance really is the ultimate sin.
