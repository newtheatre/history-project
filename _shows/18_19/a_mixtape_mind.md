Growing up Tahlia would record herself and everything else using a tape recorder her mum gave to her. She would use it to relive memories, understand herself, understand society, family, friendship, love...loss - and how she would come to terms with that along side Reggie, a family friend.

Using spoken word as a medium to explore the importance of family, letting it all out and learning to let go, A Mixtape Mind is a scratch piece about memory and coming to terms with the death of a loved one.
