Tent? Check. Food and water? Check. The unceasable drive to complete your late father’s life-list? Check. When Charlie finds her father’s old birdwatching book, she sets out to find one last bird to complete it for him, for her, and for their relationship.

Built from the performers’ own experiences, Charlie can serve as an avatar for all of us. Will she be able to complete this tribute to her father before it’s too late? There’s only one way to find out. The Backpack Ensemble presents to you a story full of music, shadows and a feathered giant.
