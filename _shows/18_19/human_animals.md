In a dystopian London the animals are starting to rise up. At least that’s what the people in charge would have you believe. Roads are closed, curfews are being imposed and buildings burnt to help curb the epidemic. Some residents want to stand up and question why their lives are being thrown into disarray, while others want to keep their heads down and carry on as if nothing is happening. Human Animals is a parable of our times that takes a look at how people respond to hardship, authority and revolution, and how much a world can be affected when people choose to ignore the warning signs.
