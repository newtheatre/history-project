A new one-woman show. We meet Stephanie, a twentysomething who has just moved to the city for a fresh start. She takes us through the disaster that is her life so far - drunken sex, awkward waxes, the list goes on. Now's her chance to become a new woman with her own place and a cure for her box-set addiction. But something still feels like it's missing and it's not just a boyfriend. A touching comedy exploring how we deal with loss.
