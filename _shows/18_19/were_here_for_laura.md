Laura Penbrooke died 3 months ago and her closest friends are still reeling. There’s Mitton, the D list reality TV star desperate to stay relevant and famous, Alex, the spoilt rich boy who is on perpetual gap year to discover himself. Paul, the delusional musical theatre student. And Carol from Finance, the work obsessed secretary whose last name is a mystery. As they come together for a dinner to remember Laura they realise that not only did they hate Laura, but they actually hate each other too. As the dinner progresses the friends realise it’s the perfect opportunity to air out all their grievances. This irreverent comedy focuses on what friendship means and the opportunity we all have to change at any moment.
