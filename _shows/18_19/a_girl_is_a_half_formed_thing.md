#    quote: "A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing deals with some incredibly distressing themes, including cancer, death, grooming, abuse, incest, and more. So why was such an intense text chosen for production? Crighton states \"I read a lot of texts over the summer trying to decide what to put on, but this was the only one that jumped out at me. I’m a very visual person so I have to be able to see the set and how I’d do it instantly in my head, and I certainly had that with this\"."

‘I met a man. I met a man. And I lay down. And slapped and cried and wined and dined. I met a man and many more and I didn’t know you at all.’

In religious, rural Ireland, a young girl takes us on a journey through her tumultuous life. Privy to her every thought as she lives through the experiences and traumas that will shape her forever.

Eimear McBride’s revolutionary experimental novel, transformed into an engaging play, explores what it is to love, lose and hurt, and to experience the world as a half-formed thing.
