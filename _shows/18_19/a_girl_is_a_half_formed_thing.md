‘I met a man. I met a man. And I lay down. And slapped and cried and wined and dined. I met a man and many more and I didn’t know you at all.’

In religious, rural Ireland, a young girl takes us on a journey through her tumultuous life. Privy to her every thought as she lives through the experiences and traumas that will shape her forever.

Eimear McBride’s revolutionary experimental novel, transformed into an engaging play, explores what it is to love, lose and hurt, and to experience the world as a half-formed thing.
