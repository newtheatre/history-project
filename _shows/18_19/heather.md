Heather Eames is the writer of the hugely popular new children’s fantasy book called Greta and the Pen of Necromancer. We learn of her success through a series of emails between herself and her editor, Harry. As starts to be seen as the next JK Rowling, the question lingers who is Heather Eames and why does she keep making excuses for not wanting to be seen? ‘Heather’ is a play which asks 2 questions: what do we value more, the storyteller or the story? Do we really know who we are talking to behind the screen?
