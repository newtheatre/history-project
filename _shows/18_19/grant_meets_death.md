One night a man named Grant McKenzie wakes up to find Death standing over his bed. Death has come with one purpose only, to take Grant’s life. Grant desperately wants to live, and an overworked Death wants their lunch break. So a deal is struck, Grant and Death use Grant’s (last?) 90 minutes going back through Grant’s memories to decide whether he deserves to live or die. Darkly comedic and slightly surreal, 'Grant Meets Death' explores through montages, music and a literal trolley problem, the question of what each individual life is worth. Through a rollercoaster of both heart-warming and painful memories, this new piece of theatre explores a life from beginning to end and attempts to reassure us all that every life is unique, even if we all meet Death in the end.
