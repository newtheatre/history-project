After the success of award winning show 'Bost-Uni Plues', Ugly Bucket brings you '2 Clowns 1 Cup', a physical verbatim show and this time it's all about sex!

Sex. It's raw, passionate, intimate and fulfilling. But sometimes, sex can be downright funny.

We like to talk about sex privately with our friends. In the comfort of confidentiality, we swap tips, stories that are hot and some are not. But how much are we really willing to share?

Ugly Bucket Theatre have invited women to dish all the dirty details, and now they invite you to join two clowns on a wild journey of sex and self-discovery as these stories and experiences are brought to life in true Ugly Bucket Style.

From puberty to puppetry, condoms to clowning, music and masturbation, '2 Clowns 1 Cup' explores everything unsexy in sex, with little left to the imagination.

Sexy, honest and stupid. Ugly Bucket's new piece of extra physical theatre will leave you begging for more.

Warning - you will get wet!
