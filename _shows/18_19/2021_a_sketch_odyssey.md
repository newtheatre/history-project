"Your writers were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should." - Dr Ian Malcolm, chaos theorist and sketch critic.

In a world where humans work alongside robots, cars can drive themselves, and clones are available on every high street, our actors will muddle through this brave new world while trying not to scuff their shiny chrome spacesuits. Expect parodies of Doctor Who, Star Wars and Jurassic Park as we prove once and for all that laughs find a way!
