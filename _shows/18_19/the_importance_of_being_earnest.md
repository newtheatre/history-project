The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy For Serious People, is Oscar Wilde's last play published before imprisonment for homosexuality and is a comedy revolving around the Victorian Upper Classes. This show has been praised by both its contemporary and modern critics, and with its mix of high farce and witty dialogue, it has become one of the most loved and enduring plays from the Victorian era. Earnest satires the views of mortality of the time, as well as the views of marriage, which should be an institution, and about what is in the end most important; being Ernest or to be Earnest.

This show was cast, rehearsed, and teched in 72 hours.
