Part celebration, part purgation, this is a verbatim reading of texts we sent people between the ages of 13-18, with all the nasty bits left in. Awful flirting, no knowledge of sociel cues, and an overabundance of `;)`, 'Risky Texts We Sent As Teens' is an exploration of romance, youth, and embarrassment performed to you by two adults who are just trying to forget about the whole thing.
