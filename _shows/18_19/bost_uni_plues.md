Winner of the Best Director and Best Production at the Liverpool Fringe 2018, and winner of the Stephen Jeffrey's Award, a Spotlight most promising actor award, and The Holbeck Cup at NSDF 2019, Ugly Bucket Theatre returns to Nottingham with Bost-Uni Plues, described as 'electric', 'brave', and 'heartbreaking yet f\*ing hilarious!'

Everyone says that university is the best three years of your life! So what happens next? Based on true experiences told by graduates, join three clowns as they leave the comfort of timetables, deadlines, and student life behind and enter the real world. A world full of expectation, proper jobs, and council tax. Bost-Uni Plues is an explosion of energy, honesty, dance, movement, techno, and plain silliness that explores life after graduation. Because when you're told that the best three years of your life are behind you, what else is left other than post-uni blues?

'It was fast, it was physical, it was funny, and it hit you right in the gut!' - Liverpool Arts Society

'The unfaltering energy and enthusiasm displayed by these performers was incredible' - Spy in the stalls London

'Ugly Bucket Theatre explore post-uni blues through the good, the bad, and the ugly, and I found myself thinking every soon to be or recent graduate should see this show' - HTDT
