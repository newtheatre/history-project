A stand-up poetry show about dead dogs, chocolate and nostalgia.

In his debut solo outing, Bróccán Tyzack-Carlin presents a semi-coherent exploration of nothing in particular, using some words that rhyme and some more that don't. 

'Don't Bother' blends surreal humour with storytelling and spoken word for a unique hour of comedy.
