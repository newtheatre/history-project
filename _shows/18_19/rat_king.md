    quote: One of the strangest plays I've seen in a long while, but isn't it good to give an audience something off the wall and new, and something for them to question after they leave the theatre?

---

Robin dreams of rodents in the wall that seem to rule all and an eldritch voice that whispers to him across the immensity of space and time. His daughter is struggling to reconnect him with reality, whilst he is frantically trying to hold on to what is left of his mind. But what does this all have to do with an uninvited guest, twin radio and television presenters with an uncanny knack for prediction and the fact that everyone keeps bloody singing?!
