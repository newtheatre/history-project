It’s the 1970s in a Northern town and the night before Dave and Linda’s wedding. Both are out on the town for their Stag and Hen parties. Each group is celebrating the forthcoming nuptials hard (some a little too much) until they realise that both have ended up in the same night club.

Through the drunken conversations in the club toilets, problems start to arise in the forms of cold feet, past exes arriving and wedding superstitions. Will Dave manage to spend any of his stag night out of the toilet, or more importantly will there be a bride at the wedding the next morning?
