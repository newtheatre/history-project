Eve meets Adam. Eve and Adam fall in love. Adam proposes to Eve. Adam marries Eve. How complicated can it be?

Women and men are equal in todayâ€™s society yet there are hundreds of gender biased choices that we make every day, stereotypes that we choose to conform to, double standards that we see as the norm and embrace. Society still looks down on stay-at-home dads, over-sexualisation of women is on the rise, the groom always says his wedding vows first, and heels are reserved for women and drag queens.

Through exploring the extremes of gendered power dynamics and heteronormative behaviour the question we seek to answer is; why do individuals in modern society choose traditional gender roles when the world around them is full of equality and empowerment?
