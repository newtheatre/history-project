In the not so distant future, technology has made it possible for people to skip the mourning process. In fact, you can forget about whoever you wish through Forgetfulness Therapy. Dot is trying to do just that to lose all memory of her late husband Luca. With the reluctant help of her sister-in-law, Margot, she goes about setting her life in order and leaving Luca behind. However, Margot has a plan to make sure Dot remembers Luca forever. By compiling the history of Luca’s private messages and online presence, she is able to make Dot fall in love with him all over again. The problem is, it’s not really Luca and unbeknownst to Margot, Dot had other reasons for wanting to forget him.
