"One small step for man, one giant leap for... S**t... line!"

1960s America, and small town middle management employee Stuart James' life is about to change beyond belief. Moved from the Smalltown Department of Facial Equality, Stuart receives a command from "the Big Boss"... He is to help beat the Communists in the race to landing men on the Moon. The only issue is... he doesn't have a clue how to do it. With the help of epic film director, Steven Kosminski, the most difficult group of actors known to Earth-kind; and with press, spies and suspicion surrounding them at every turn, watch Stuart try and fail to mount the largest scam ever thrown upon the world in this hilarious modern farce; which explores conspiracy theories, 1960s American pop culture and why we love to believe nothing in history's ever right.
