He watches you. He thinks that your life is so mundane that only he can redeem it. He writes stories about you and adds chapter upon chapter of fictionalised content to replace your existence with an alternate that views him as the protagonist rather than a mere voyeur. Liberty is his favourite target. Watching her through her webcam, he becomes more intensely obsessed with her than anyone before. He will allow nothing to interrupt his stories or prevent his access to people’s private lives.

An allegorical play about governmental invasion of our privacy, 'When I Watch You, I Like to Leave the Sound Off' shows the obsessive voyeurism of present-day national security, from Britain’s GCHQ to the USA’s Patriot Act.
