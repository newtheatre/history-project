"The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there."

The Lady believes she is fine. She is happy with her world, dismissive of the new and staunchly opposes conflicting ideas to her truth. However, two demons plague her mind, Time and the People. They slowly begin to challenge the Lady's current outlook of the world, questioning the beliefs she once held, coming to the crushing realisation she is trapped in another period of history, disconnected from the events of today. Is she too late to change herself to the times we live in?

A work-in-progress play ripe for an audience of 2019, this play addresses past conceptions of ourselves, pitting them against modern day issues, and offering some perspectives of how to prepare for the future.
