‘What was so brilliant, was the spectacle of it all. Like fireworks on your first kiss. I felt beautiful.’

Ophelia falls in love. Her world view realigns as she becomes infatuated, dreaming romantic visions of new landscapes and colour. Then he leaves. Deranged by rejection, Ophelia finds no choice but to end everything. Standing at the water’s edge, its darkness seems irresistible… and somehow utterly beautiful. Hamlet’s Ophelia is brought into the 21st Century in this interactive one-woman show, scrutinising our world obsession with finding beauty in female tragedy. 
This is a Research and Development piece in preparation for a run produced by Fishhouse Theatre in Leicester, taking place at Upstairs at the Western in November 2019. The show will therefore be followed by an audience feedback session.
