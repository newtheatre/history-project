Never-seen-before... Never-to-be-seen again! 

Presenting 'Hard Truths' - a completely improvised one-act play that will hopefully find the funny out of our real lives! The audience will be asked to suggest a question for our improvisers to answer honestly, and from there they'll weave a fabulous narrative from all their confessions. 

Expect absolute hilarity and gut-wrenching heartbreak in the same hour.

Expect to laugh and cry at the same time!

Anything can happen, so what are you waiting for?
