In the Nottingham New Theatre from the 7th-8th November we will be showcasing 'Unscripted: The Preview' for the first time ever. This gives you a chance to have a taste of what our Unscripted actors do, and get involved with our next show if you like what you see! Going by the name of 'Freshers Meat' it is a short, hilarious and (surely) relatable play about freshers week and the hilarious and (sometimes questionable) events that unfold, taken from experience from university members across Nottingham. It is written and devised completely by the cast and crew! It is only Â£3, so please come along, we would love to see you there.
