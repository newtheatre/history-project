Within five years of Scotland voting yes to independence, the King is murdered, and the country is thrown into panic. Those watching the events unfold from both inside and outside begin to question: Can the young monarchy survive such a brutal murder? And who would hate the King enough to commit such a heartless act?
Loosely based on a well-known Shakespearean play, this immersive theatre experience allows the audience to not only observe the play, but to become a part of the mystery; from witnessing the interview of a scared palace cleaner, to overhearing a sketchy midnight phone call, we begin to dive deep into a tragedy with more questions than there are answers.
