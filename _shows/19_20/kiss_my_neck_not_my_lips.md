'Kiss my neck not my lips' tackles communication and friendship in the 21st century. The play highlights how the modern generation has an inability to articulate our inner thoughts and feelings, and whether this damages our relationships.

The play, set entirely in one bedroom, follows the characters of Hen and Lydia, best friends and course mates. Taking place over a series of months, the audience watches snippets from their life. The play moves from scenes of girlish preening, to intimate night-time chats, to jealousy-fuelled arguments. We watch as the girlâ€™s dynamic changes, as their inability to communicate with one another is brought more and more to the surface.

Watch as a female friendship walks along the tightrope of romance.
