Lovers, and magic, and warring fairies; what could possibly go wrong?
Welcome to the Athenian forest, where nothing is as it seems. Hermia and Lysander elope in the dead of night pursued by Demetrius who is pursued by Helena, all falling straight into the middle of a feud between the King and Queen of the fairies. In a play about mistakes and misunderstandings, the characters fight with each other and themselves to turn their upset world into a place of peace and love, resulting in a series of plans gone-wrong that put them far out of their depth.
Hilarious, over-the-top and comically disastrous, this is the Shakespeare that you know and love (but with a little bit more neon paint!)
