Lisa sent her watch off to be fixed, as it is running an hour behind, but on receiving it back is
told that in fact she has lost an hour. Lisa is now on a mission to find her lost hour and get her life back on track. The wonderful world she travels to, Dissocia, is a colourful and off-
kilter place full of funny and strange characters. However, something brutal and wicked lies just behind the surface of this happy place and once Lisa realises what’s happening, all hell breaks loose.
Anthony Neison’s play is dynamic and thought-provoking, full of music, comedy and sudden
bursts of harsh reality, in exploring a world of psychological disconnection.
