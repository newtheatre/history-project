Green, orange, red, blue, purple, pink; it almost feels like love if you close your eyes hard enough. It almost feels like reality if you clench your fists around the memory. If you think about her face with all your soul, for every second of every day, then maybe you can stop it from crumbling to dust. If you wish on every star you see then maybe she’ll come back to you, she’ll find a way. She always did.
'Higher' is an abstract piece which explores the psychological effects of love and loss, through a combination of drama, poetry, and dance.
