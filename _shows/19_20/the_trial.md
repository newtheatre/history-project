‘The Trial’ is part stand-up & part gig, interactive storytelling by Franko Figueiredo & Ines Sampaio. ‘The Trial’ questions gender constructions in the 21st century. Can we reject authority, and live & love in a different way?

This hyper theatrical performance hosts many musical instruments, a microphone and a loop-pedal, and the audience is invited to join her on a journey of questioning, growth and discovery, and to be unprejudiced witnesses and play jury.
