War has now been raging for many years. Peace is as good as forgotten, soldiers have become a part of everyday life and death is more visible than ever. But now Franz is home, with his loving wife Marie, and both are as safe as can be. So why is it that he cannot seem to trust anybody? Why can he barely look his baby daughter in the eye, or even acknowledge her existence? And who exactly is the mysterious Drummer getting in the way of Franz's happiness? Loosely based on Georg Buchner's incomplete 19th century German classic 'Woyzeck', this modern adaptation focusses on how we remember victims of war, and how easy it is to fail them.
