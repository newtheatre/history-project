    quote: "The play is not performed very often, anywhere, and I can see why because of the gritty, hard hitting story and the immense emotional involvement that is needed. It takes a special team of production folk and actors to deliver such an amazing and special, as well as emotionally draining piece of theatre. When it is done as well as this team have done it though, it isn't one that should be missed."

Davey has seen something he can never forget... Anita has been forced to flee her home after her son, Vincent, was murdered in a homophobic attack. She has been trying to come to terms with both her loss and his concealed sexuality, but her grief is further complicated by Davey’s arrival at her home. The battered and bruised seventeen-year-old boy confesses to Anita that he has been unable to escape Vincent’s ghost. Tonight they meet for the first time... and their lives change forever.
Thrilling, heartbreaking and darkly humorous, Vincent River is a powerful exploration of hate crime and flaws within our society.
