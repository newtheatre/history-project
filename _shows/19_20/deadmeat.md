Join our documentary team in investigating the disappearance of a group of teenagers! 

Through found footage from the 1990s, we explore what happened when a group of teenagers arrive at an abandoned house for what they thought would be a fun get-away. Little do they know, as the night wears on, we soon realise that people may not be who they say they are as one by one they become victim to the horrors that lie within.
 
Get ready for a hilarious and (almost certainly) spooky production written and devised completely by the cast and crew! Keep an eye out, you don’t know who or what could be lurking in the shadows…
