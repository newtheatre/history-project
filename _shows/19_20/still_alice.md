Alice Howland is a University professor at the peak of her career before she is diagnosed with early-
onset Alzheimer’s disease. With a husband and two children, Alice strives to remain as independent as possible despite her deteriorating mental state. The play not only follows Alice’s fluctuating
mental state but examines that of her surrounding family who struggle to come to terms with her
condition. This play aims to present the experiences and struggles of living with Alzheimer’s, giving
the audience a brilliant insight into how both Alice’s and her family’s lives change when Alice’s
Alzheimer’s effects both her relationship with herself and those around her.
