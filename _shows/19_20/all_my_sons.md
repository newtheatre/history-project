Two years after the conclusion of the Second World War, the Keller family have settled back into day-to-day life in a small American town. Their only sorrow comes from the heartache of the loss of their eldest son, Larry, who was pronounced Missing, Assumed Dead during the War. While Joe and his youngest son, Chris, have come to terms with Larry's death, the mother of the family, Kate, refuses to accept the truth. When Larry's ex-fiancée arrives with the intention of marrying Chris, the family begins to fragment and secrets that were thought to be buried come to light.
