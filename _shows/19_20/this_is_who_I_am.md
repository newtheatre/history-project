Ice & Fire explores human rights stories through performance. 

'They separated us. We tried to say no, we applied for asylum as a couple. They say we don’t have any civil evidence that we are a couple. And we’re like “how can we show you any civil evidence if homosexuality is forbidden in my country?”'

Read by performers, 'This Is Who I Am' interweaves first hand accounts of LGBTQIA+ peoples experiences of the UK asylum process. This reading will be performed at the Nottingham New Theatre for LGBTQ+ and History month.

The reading will be followed by a Q&A discussion panel, and a couple of short talks from charities working with refugees in Nottingham.
