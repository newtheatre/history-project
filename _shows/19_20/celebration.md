    quote: "As long as you're not easily offended by some choice swear words or by talk about carnal activities behind filing cabinets or un-natural activities between a son and his mother (well it was good enough for Shakespeare), then you'll love this lampoon of social classes and behaviour. I for one loved it, and now I want more Pinter in my theatre and literary education."

In a tacky restaurant, two gangster brothers, formerly from the East End but now "strategy consultants"are celebrating a wedding anniversary with their wives, who are sisters. At the next table, a banker is dining with his wife, formerly his secretary. Moving almost musically Pinter’s unsettling dialogue guides us through the couples stifled and repressed relationships, plunging the audience from vapid, empty and yet hilarious conversation leading to surreal moments of characters allowing their inner dialogue to spill out of their mouths. The staff of the restaurant weave in and out of the story, providing some relief with a laugh before one of the waiters gives an unsettling final monologue.
