“Here at the centre of everything, journeys end and nightmares are born.” As Ollie searches Manchester for her missing sister, she finds every lead seems to guide her to a concrete island in the middle of the city: Pomona. Seemingly a vacuous space with no evidence of human life, the reality of what happens beneath the concrete sucks in any seemingly ‘good’ person and ultimately questions what a person could do in the right circumstance. A sinister and surreal thriller, Pomona disconcertingly blurs the lines between horror games and a much more nightmarish reality.
