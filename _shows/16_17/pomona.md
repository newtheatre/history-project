    quote: "This play is very difficult to describe, story wise. Thinking about it, I don't think any description of the play would do it justice because it's like a virtual jigsaw where all the pieces fall into place right at the end."

    quote: "It may look organised on the surface – characters marching in rows in the shopping centre – but there is a primal, visceral underworld that holds all the power. Strauss makes sure we are on the edge of our seats throughout the play; even if we’re laughing it’s still bloody unnerving."

trivia:
  - quote: The moment that sticks out here is when I plotted the opening sequence alone, and upon running it with the cast they all broke character and went "SICK!" as the lights started flashing in time to the music.

“Here at the centre of everything, journeys end and nightmares are born.” As Ollie searches Manchester for her missing sister, she finds every lead seems to guide her to a concrete island in the middle of the city: Pomona. Seemingly a vacuous space with no evidence of human life, the reality of what happens beneath the concrete sucks in any seemingly ‘good’ person and ultimately questions what a person could do in the right circumstance. A sinister and surreal thriller, Pomona disconcertingly blurs the lines between horror games and a much more nightmarish reality.
