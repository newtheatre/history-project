Caryl Churchill’s Love and Information is a kaleidoscopic play of short scenes addressing contemporary issues around knowledge, technology, communication, and our capacity for relationships. It touches on the fragility of human emotion and the ways in which we relate to, and make sense of the world. Who do you love?
