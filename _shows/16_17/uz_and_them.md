    quote: "Uz and Them is an intensely clever and confidently realised piece of theatre, with powerful performances and moments of real weight. With some work to make the piece a little more accessible and sharper, Uz and Them has the potential to be a truly evocative piece of theatre."

    quote: "However, it was not so much the interpersonal relationships but rather the oddness of the script that made the play so interesting. It certainly became clear that you’d never be able to guess where the plotline would lead you next, or indeed whether the next discussion about worms or autumn was even vaguely related to the last."

    quote: "Writer and Director Jonathan Taylor-Davis had borrowed, ever so slightly from the Book Of Job from the First Testament to create something not too far removed from a Monty Python sketch for it's ridiculousness."

A jury goes on trial and must pass judgement on itself. The truth is an abundant commodity which the law cannot seem to grasp. Like panning for gold in the wrong river, a mysterious court full of bluster, bile, and bewilderment dances around the point while sharing stories with an audience who must ultimately decide their own fate.
