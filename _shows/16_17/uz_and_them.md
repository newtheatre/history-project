A jury goes on trial and must pass judgement on itself. The truth is an abundant commodity which the law cannot seem to grasp. Like panning for gold in the wrong river, a mysterious court full of bluster, bile, and bewilderment dances around the point while sharing stories with an audience who must ultimately decide their own fate.
