    quote: "Experimental theatre with hilarious results! Yee Heng Yeh’s All The World’s a Stage and Other Stories is a brilliant play that blurs the boundaries, to say the least, whilst transporting you into everyday worlds that make you reflect on whether we are all just players on a stage."

A director tries his hand at experimental theatre, to disastrous results. An incompetent doctor watches the auditions of a talent show, where the judges start an argument. A machine becomes sentient to the horror of a careers adviser. And a dictator has a friendly chat with the man he put in prison, only to discover that something is very, very wrong…

In a triple bill of absurdist theatre, these original short plays combine the farcical and the meta-theatrical, blurring the boundaries between reality and drama, between audience and actors.
