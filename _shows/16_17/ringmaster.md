    quote: "What I liked about this piece of theatre is that there is no right or wrong ending and is subjective to the mind of the audience member. it means that the audience will go away thinking about the play and discussing what they came to decide, also giving rise to debate."

Run away to the circus. What an exciting idea, hey? Well, bring into the midst of this a rivalry between a clown and a ringmaster and a potential murder plot and you may regret your decisions. Join three storytellers who all seem to know a little bit more or less than they lead on about a botched highwire stunt, as you too are encouraged to decide who you believe in a play which explores human psychology, illusion, deception and who to believe when confronted with conflicting perceptions of the truth in a maze of monologues. Sound chaotic? Terrifying? Wondrous? Endearing? Welcome to the circus!
