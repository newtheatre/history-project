    quote: "Overall, the play is unusual, interesting and has a contemporary feel, and with a little work it has the elements to become something new and exciting. The Ringmaster is indeed a great addition to the New Theatre’s Fringe Season."

Run away to the circus. What an exciting idea, hey? Well, bring into the midst of this a rivalry between a clown and a ringmaster and a potential murder plot and you may regret your decisions. Join three storytellers who all seem to know a little bit more or less than they lead on about a botched highwire stunt, as you too are encouraged to decide who you believe in a play which explores human psychology, illusion, deception and who to believe when confronted with conflicting perceptions of the truth in a maze of monologues. Sound chaotic? Terrifying? Wondrous? Endearing? Welcome to the circus!
