*Strangers* returns to its spiritual home at the Nottingham New Theatre with four brand new scenes. In the same way that a musical blends theatre with music and lyrics, *Strangers: A Magic Play II* blends theatre with magic and illusion. Stories are interwoven with magic to create an audience experience which challenges what and how we think about magic and performance.
