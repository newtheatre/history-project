In the heart of Rotherham, a shabby yet beloved local restaurant is opening up its doors for the usual lunchtime rush. But when a new bistro opens up just down the street, it could compromise the business for good. Itâ€™s up to owner, Bernard, and his two trusty employees, Barry and Norman, to endeavour on the pursuit of a lifetime to save their brassiere and reclaim their rightful positions as trailblazers on the Yorkshire scene of French Cuisine.
