In the heart of Rotherham, a shabby yet beloved local restaurant is opening up its doors for the usual lunchtime rush. But when a new bistro opens up just down the street, it could compromise the business for good. It’s up to owner, Bernard, and his two trusty employees, Barry and Norman, to endeavour on the pursuit of a lifetime to save their brassiere and reclaim their rightful positions as trailblazers on the Yorkshire scene of French Cuisine.
