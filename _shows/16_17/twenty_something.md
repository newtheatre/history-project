Noah and Maisy are brother and sister, they are both Twenty-Something and are not living the perfect lives they'd imagined for themselves. As an argument at a family dinner unfolds, we watch them retell the moments in their lives that lead them to where they are now. The good, the bad and the just plain embarrassing. With an important decision to be made, Noah and Maisy are under pressure to tell their side of the story and make the right choice.
