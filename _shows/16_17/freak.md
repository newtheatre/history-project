    quote: "\"Freak\" is a powerful piece of drama and a great start to Nottingham New Theatre's new season, it will make you think, it will make you laugh and hopefully it will get you talking as well, and if you're quite truthful with yourself, it may make you change your attitude towards how you treat people, both male and female attitudes that is."

Georgie is thirty with dirty secrets. She drinks in her room and hides from the world. Leah is fifteen with teenage dreams. She practises her cum face and Veets. A lot. All-meat, all sex, all-vulnerable, all-powerful. There’s a first time for everything…Isn’t there? Anna Jordan’s witty, entwining monologues combine to ask what sexual empowerment looks like in this day and age. 'Freak' is a full-on, unabashed exploration of the expectations placed upon and ultimately adopted by women in an age where it is possible to receive a high-definition sex education before having your first kiss.
