Georgie is thirty with dirty secrets. She drinks in her room and hides from the world. Leah is fifteen with teenage dreams. She practises her cum face and Veets. A lot. All-meat, all sex, all-vulnerable, all-powerful. There’s a first time for everything…Isn’t there? Anna Jordan’s witty, entwining monologues combine to ask what sexual empowerment looks like in this day and age. 'Freak' is a full-on, unabashed exploration of the expectations placed upon and ultimately adopted by women in an age where it is possible to receive a high-definition sex education before having your first kiss.
