    quote: "[T]he show truly shines when the actors are interacting with and playing off one another, be it screaming expletives in someone’s face, struggling for the spotlight, or coming together for a dance or pose or magic trick."

    quote: "All actors are thoroughly engaging with their different and diverse, quirky character personalities. But you do feel a bit for George who at the end really does everything, quite literally, thrown at him by the cast, and comes up smiling."

Six performers are about to put on the show of a lifetime, but when one member is late they must frantically improvise to keep their audience entertained. Unprepared and erratic, the performers’ desperate bid to salvage the show results in hilarious efforts of audience interaction; magic tricks, stand-up routines and recollecting a goldfish massacre, they will stop at nothing to perform. As their desperation grows, the performers begin to turn on each other and, eventually, the audience, calling into question the real relationship between performers and spectators.
