Six performers are about to put on the show of a lifetime, but when one member is late they must frantically improvise to keep their audience entertained. Unprepared and erratic, the performersâ€™ desperate bid to salvage the show results in hilarious efforts of audience interaction; magic tricks, stand-up routines and recollecting a goldfish massacre, they will stop at nothing to perform. As their desperation grows, the performers begin to turn on each other and, eventually, the audience, calling into question the real relationship between performers and spectators.
