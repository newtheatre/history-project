    quote: "All of the actors should be highly commended for their outstanding acting; each contributing to making this play, which deals with heavy themes such as political radicalism, rape and disconnection, heart-wrenching yet relatable for the audience."

    quote: "I came away from this piece of theatre with many thoughts in my head about all four characters and can empathise with all four. The blend of brilliant, emotional acting and an amazingly well written script really gives you plenty to mull over long after the play has ended."

These four people all have trauma in their past. They are weighed down by personal demons which refuse to let go. Each has something to fear and a reason to fear it. Rachel is recovering from a breakdown, Lewis is politically radical, Zoe is a budding poet and Arthur is trying desperately to be a parent. They all lead seemingly unrelated lives and yet one by one they gradually come to know each other and develop a connection that even they cannot understand. These unrelated people will start to find beauty and pain in each other as they struggle to maintain their senses of identity and purpose. Through a performance of monologues and spoken word poems, follow Zoe, Arthur, Rachel and Lewis as they struggle through the ups and downs of modern life, seeking redemption in those they love and those they may lose.
