You give us suggestions and we’ll give you a show! 

*Improvabunga!* is the totally improvised movie-adventure-extravaganza. Featuring live musical accompaniment and buzzers which you'll use to control the performers. There’ll be songs, there’ll be tears, there’ll be kisses (or slaps) and there will be funny. 

Hot on the heels of their performances at ImprofestUK and the Birmingham Improv Festival, the Watch This Improv Troupe are back for their 13th Edinburgh Fringe and are ready to create a fantastic story before your very eyes.
