An exuberant family fa√ßade that is just about ready to crack. Music, magic, poetry, drag and comedy meet in an explosive night of would-be redemption for the former celebs, but the cabaret-style comeback night just goes further and further off course. Played in by a live funk band, fronted by the sexy Sweet Stax, lucky ticket holders are encouraged to grab a drink and strap in for the fiery return of the showbiz legends.
