Speechless is a comedy following Anna, dealing with everything from irritating journalists to self-confidence to mysterious superheroes. She's in a successful job. Earns a decent living. Lives a comfortable life. But there's something off, not quite right. I doubt you'd notice straight away, you might not be able to tell in conversation. But maybe, if you really listened, you might pick up on the obvious.
