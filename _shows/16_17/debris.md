Louise is packing her depression into boxes but needs to sift through the debris to make things finally fit. Why is Cornwall so scary? Why do the black balloon dogs keep following her? Why does she constantly need to pee? And why is spreading butter on toast such a big deal? Raising awareness and challenging attitudes towards depression and mental health, Louise makes sense of her experiences and daily vices with some much needed help from David Attenborough and you, the audience.
