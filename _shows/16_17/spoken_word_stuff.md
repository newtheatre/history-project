For our late night entertainent and closing the festival, StuFF and UoN Poetry Society have teamed up with two incredible local groups to bring a evening of poetry, as well as an open mic.

For the past three years, Poetry Is Dead Good has been the foremost platform for poetry and spoken word in Nottingham, striving to showcase the very best poetic talent from Nottingham and beyond. Phlexx operates as a network of independent community artists.
