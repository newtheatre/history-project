  - quote: One rehearsal George didn't turn up. We rang him and he was in Mooch having finished his exams, so we told him what was happening and he came in. He then gave the best performance I've ever seen him give at the NNT, after which he staggered over to me and said "I'm six pints in"

From an eccentric director to a fierce love triangle and backstage crew looking for a laugh, Camp Macbeth brings new insight into drama summer camps. Being entirely devised and written by students, Camp Macbeth is a hilarious comedic take on all those stereotypes that you associate with drama camps. All proceeds from Camp Macbeth go to the 2016-17 Season Charity Hayward House.
