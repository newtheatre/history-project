If your friend is making bad life choices, you should intervene…shouldn’t you? What about intervening on behalf of someone you’ve never met?

A and B have known each other for three years, and are ‘best friends’. Although controversial, they’ve always had a strong relationship, but now B has a new girlfriend A cannot stand, and A is becoming more reliant on alcohol. Their turbulent yet honest friendship is tested to the limit when A returns from a rally against military intervention to find B’s views are at the complete opposite end of the spectrum. Bartlett interrogates the notion of friendship and how far your duty as a friend extends to your duty as a civil human being. This play scrutinises the limits of true friendship and social responsibility in a world losing touch with basic humanity.
