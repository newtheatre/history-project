    quote: "The performances in this piece are stunning. It is undeniably a character piece, and the two actresses perform their roles with sublime conviction. They play off of each other perfectly, and the on-stage chemistry will convince you that they have been life-long friends."

    quote: "You could class the play as an intelligent comedy of sorts. a funny play, but it's also a sad play about being faithful and true to your friends when they need that crutch the most, but also being slightly neglectful of that friendship, but the final scenes say it all."

If your friend is making bad life choices, you should intervene…shouldn’t you? What about intervening on behalf of someone you’ve never met?

A and B have known each other for three years, and are ‘best friends’. Although controversial, they’ve always had a strong relationship, but now B has a new girlfriend A cannot stand, and A is becoming more reliant on alcohol. Their turbulent yet honest friendship is tested to the limit when A returns from a rally against military intervention to find B’s views are at the complete opposite end of the spectrum. Bartlett interrogates the notion of friendship and how far your duty as a friend extends to your duty as a civil human being. This play scrutinises the limits of true friendship and social responsibility in a world losing touch with basic humanity.
