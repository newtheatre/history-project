    quote: "The shapes of Trueman’s blocking are visually satisfying and he clearly played to each actor’s strengths when devising their characters and comic tropes. Every single member of the cast is also completely committed to their character and attentive to their physical characterisation."

    quote: "The six actors all create distinctive characters: Maggie is very serious, Billy is earnest, and Francois is Machiavellian. These different approaches could have been jarring, but instead they highlight the qualities of their characters and it meshes together nicely. However, one thing that all of them have in common is that they are all caricatures of swashbuckling pirates, and are all hopelessly incompetent at leading."

 Loosely based on *The Tempest*, this show is an absurd political satire chronicling two days in the lives of six pirates, and one dead parrot, shipwrecked on a tropical island. These buffoonish buccaneers turn on one another, each vying for power, using different ideologies to manipulate their comrades. This fast-paced comedy explores whether institutions can ever be anything but systems for oppression and whether game theory is an accurate description of political practice.
