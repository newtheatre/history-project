Ever wanted to get away from something? Charlie has. She doesn't really enjoy her job in marketing, nor does she enjoy the company of the vacuous people that surround her, nor does she enjoy hearing that constant buzzing sound... can you hear it? So Charlie decides to run away - far away. But what she doesn't realise is that running away can be costly ordeal...

Come and watch Charlie try to navigate her way through the pitfalls of life (and death) in this brilliant dark comedy from Fin Kennedy. She will try and escape the hardest thing of all: herself. You'll discover that there are some things you can't ever escape from.
