trivia:
  - quote: We were told to bring in some clothes that would fit the 70s setting as a costume. I turned up and was told what I was wearing would be perfect. Little did they know I had a bag full of ugly shirts and high waisted jeans with me. Apparently my natural fashion sense screams 'cult member in the 70s'

    quote: "The script, written by director Iona Hampson, was clever and thoroughly believable, taking many of the words and records of the temple and presenting them verbatim, intermingling them with scenes reconstructed from such records. The fact that these words were directly from the victims and witnesses of the tragedy made it all the more powerful and the conclusion all the more heart-breaking."

During the early years of the Civil Rights Movement in America, the People’s Temple arose. With the charismatic Jim Jones as leader, the congregation grew due to his captivating rhetoric of equality and socialism at a time of great social unrest and segregation. Jim appeared to be an answer to their prayers and desires, yet the cult soon realised that the utopia they loved had a dystopian undercurrent waiting to explode. Based upon true events and inspired by archival materials including audio clips and footage, the play explores the rise and fall of the infamous Jim Jones and his cult. This is not a play about the ‘dangers of religion.’ Its purpose is to educate, remember and humanise the congregation at the People’s Temple, who joined the community as an attempt to escape from the hatred and social injustice they witnessed in a broken, modern America.
