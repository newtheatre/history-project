“Love affairs are timeless, I mean, they don't change. That's why these songs on Rumours are timeless, I think. And that's why they're timeless to me and that's why I can walk out on the stage today and still sing them... and still feel the same way as when I wrote them is because I can remember so how I felt at that point, and I can remember the tears, and I can remember how hard it was for me to play.” ‘Rumours’ is a play recounting the lives of Fleetwood Mac at the time of the recording of their most infamous album. Focussing on the bands battle to stay together, despite all the struggles and heartache the band were dealing with at the time. The sound, the songs, the heartbreak, the tension. The making of music history. The making of Fleetwood Mac.
