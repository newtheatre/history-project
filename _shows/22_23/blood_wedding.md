García Lorca's passionate, lyrical tale of longing and revenge: a twentieth century masterpiece.

A young woman’s desperate attempts to preserve the life that she wants for herself clashes with her community’s expectations of her. In so doing, she rekindles an old blood feud, unleashing a village’s anger onto her. 

What follows is a dramatic prediction of the violence that will grip the country and end Lorca’s own life.

A story based on true events about the power of anger, the danger of passion and the cruelty of religious patriarchy.

A production by arrangement with Nick Hern Books.
