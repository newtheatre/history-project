García Lorca's passionate, lyrical tale of longing and revenge: a twentieth
century masterpiece.
A young woman’s desperate attempts to preserve the life that she wants
for herself clashes with her community’s expectations of her. In so doing,
she rekindles an old blood feud, unleashing a village’s anger onto her.
What follows is a dramatic prediction of the violence that will grip the
country and end Lorca’s own life.
A story based on true events about the power of anger, the danger of
passion and the cruelty of religious patriarchy.

A production by arrangement with Nick Hern Books.
