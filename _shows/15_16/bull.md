      This is one play in which the good guy doesn't win in the end although it is questionable who in the audience would like to see him do so[...] this sterling production by Nottingham New Theatre starts their new season off with a tremendous bang.

      An unmissable play, with actors that deserve to be on the larger stages of this world in the future. "STAND UP FOR YOURSELF" Thomas is told, yet Gill presents how difficult that truly is with predators such as Dillon, Baines and Bradley on the prowl. Bull is most definitely taking theatre by the horns in this uncomfortable but consuming spectacle.

Three employees, two jobs, one boss, and a cutthroat attitude. Mike Bartlett’s Olivier award winning play, Bull, is an allegory of Spanish bullfighting and a 45 minute white knuckle ride through the manipulative world of the modern workplace. Isobel, Thomas, and Tony are each scrambling to save their jobs with one destined for the sack from their daunting boss Carter. Surely his decision will be fair? Don’t be so sure. Two colleagues lie, cheat, taunt and victimise their way to success in order to make the other see red. This play is a stark and brutal look at bullying in the workplace which is guaranteed to hit you hard like a shot of tequila and make you squirm uncomfortably in your seat.
