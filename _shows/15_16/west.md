    quote: "Will Pimblett’s lighting design, combined with the smoke laden stage is rather effective in conjuring the choking fog that tormented 60s London. "

West by Steven Berkoff, first published in 1983, is a parable that follows Mike, leader of the N16 Gang, as he gears up to take on his most fearsome enemy, The
King of Hoxton. Written as a sequel to his coming of age play East, West is set against a backdrop of sex, violence, the Kray Twins and fish cakes. As his story progresses, we see Mike and his gang tell their tale through high-energy physical theatre and comedy, as Mike’s girlfriend and parents continually question his actions. At it’s heart, West is a play about courage, and whether it’s worth it to pursue desires at the risk of alienation.
