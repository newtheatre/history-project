    quote: "In this way, Bateman’s theatre piece is giving the green light to incredible acting, as Gill appeared to shine as the narrator, as well as debatably the main character that has to experience life in West Egg and East Egg, surrounded by a “rotten crowd” of the rich American’s elite. "

In 1922, New York reaches boiling point: parties are longer, morals are looser, liquor is stronger and jazz is hotter. When impressionable Nick Carraway arrives to seek his fortune, he is drawn into the decadent, hedonistic world of America’s elite. But when tragedy strikes, he is forced to decide whether money matters more than his morality.
