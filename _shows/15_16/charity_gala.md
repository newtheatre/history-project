This show offers two one-off, script-in-hand performances showcasing the talents of Nottingham New Theatre members in extracts from a variety of texts. From plays to poetry, the evening will offer fun, excitement and emotion. The actors will have only had the day to rehearse, making this a rare and entertaining experience that gives audiences a taste of different playwrights, while raising money for some worthy causes as well.
