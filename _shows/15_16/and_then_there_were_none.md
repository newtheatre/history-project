    quote: "The simple and yet extremely effective suspending music injected just enough tension to keep the audience captivated. This in itself could have gone extremely wrong, especially when such music is often associated with the air of a cheesy 80’s detective programme. However, the subtlety of the music allowed for a far more realistic atmosphere, drawing everyone even further into the sheer mystery of the piece."

Eight unique guests are invited to an isolated island off the Devonshire coast by a mysterious host. The guests have never met one another before, nor have they met their host. While assembled for cocktails a voice comes out of the air, accusing everyone present of murder. The incident starts the chain of events, and one by one, death surreptitiously finds each one of the guests. The tense play depicts the guests’ struggle to discover their assailant before their own death penalty is awarded in line with the final line of the rhyme And Then There Were None.
