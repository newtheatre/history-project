    quote: "If you like your Shakespeare just a little different, a little more manic, a little left of centre, then this is the production to see. Alternatively, if you just want to see a good comedy presented by a very talented group of people, then this is also the production to see. Stick with it because it's worth it!"

If Monty Python and Terry Gilliam did Shakespeare, it'd be something like this. Arguably, a lot of Shakespeare’s work conveys a message of power being an inherently corrupting force - Macbeth being a prime example. Ionesco (one of the most prominent avant-garde writers within ‘The Theatre of the Absurd’) wrote Macbett as a fond parody of Macbeth. Ionesco is not mocking Shakespeare, he is satirising war and government in this profoundly funny and profane depiction of human nature.
