In the same way that a musical blends theatre with music and lyrics, Strangers: A Magic Play blends theatre with magic and illusion.

A mind reader who is told other people’s thoughts by a voice in his head.

A children’s entertainer whose private life interferes with his act.

A barista who dreams of making it big in the music industry.

A homeless man struggling to survive. 

Four separate stories are interwoven with magic to create an audience experience which challenges what we think and how we think about magic and performance.

Magic Is Dead. Long Live Magic.
