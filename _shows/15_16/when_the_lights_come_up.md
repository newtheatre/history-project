“When The Lights Come Up” will take you on an uproarious exploration of human nature. Six intrepid improvisers will journey to discover themes and characters, new worlds and plot in an hour long piece of entirely unscripted theatre that will be different every night. Come with an open mind and don’t be fooled into believing you will be seeing a comedy or a grief-stricken tragedy. Just follow us into the bright unknown. Because when the lights come up… Anything can happen.
