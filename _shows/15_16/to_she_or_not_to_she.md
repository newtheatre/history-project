“Frailty thy name is woman?! Get stuffed Will!”

Armed with the Complete Works of William Shakespeare, some rudimentary feminism and a lot of questions, Emma is here to find out exactly why she can't play Hamlet. Or Macbeth. Or Iago. Or even just a downright Fool. And not just on stage but in real life! In her semi-autobiographical solo show, Emma Bentley dons the trousers as she tackles the trials and tribulations of playing Shakespeare's men ... without a codpiece.

"Some moments reveal the work of comedic genius, whilst others conjure up a deep sense of injustice."
A Younger Theatre
