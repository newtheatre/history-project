    quote: "The understated sensitivity in which the tragedy is handled with its slower pace; the heart-breaking nature of the play comes not from the fact that it is a true story, but from the quality of the cast, and how it was directed. "

Anne Frank’s is a story that everyone knows. Amidst a backdrop of brutality and devastation, a young girl gives us an insight into the experiences of the persecuted who were battling to maintain their sense of humanity during World
War II. Anne Frank’s diary has become an essential part of how we remember one of the darkest periods in our history. It is a survival mechanism, a testament to the human spirit and its protagonist’s “boundless desire for all that is beautiful and good,” is inspirationally unfaltering. The play spans the two-year period that Anne, her family and their friends were trapped in the secret annex above Otto Frank’s office. Relationships blossom and crumble, hopes are built and shattered, and lives are put on hold.
