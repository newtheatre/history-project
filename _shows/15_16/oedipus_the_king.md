        Martin Berry has again managed to give the "wow factor" with this new play, and while this wasn't what i had
        expected, I certainly was not disappointed in the least with what i got. A very exciting production with a new
        and innovative view on the classic tragedy play.

Oedipus Rex is the powerful and self-assured King of Thebes who unwittingly fulfills a brutal and murderous prophecy. As the truth is slowly and painfully revealed, King Oedipus, his mother and his people come to realize the true horror of what he has done, leading to inevitably bloody consequences. 

The Bemused Theatre Company warmly invites you to join them in the definitive story of tragedy. Combining music, drama and theatrical flair in a performance of this 2,500 year old play that shocks audiences to this day. You wonâ€™t believe your eyes.
