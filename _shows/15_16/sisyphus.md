    quote: "With an unusual and silly ending, Sollowayâ€™s show is, however, an out and out triumph, which everyone who attended enjoyed immensely. "

"I'm no expert, but I expect it would be easy to get lost if you had no face." An interactive play about lying, adulterous bees, loneliness, single blue whales, expectations vs reality, a broken marriage between two horses, theatre and public displays of affection between frogs. Some silliness and dancing alongside some self-indulgent moaning about modern life. I think you should come and that the show's worthwhile, but then I would say that wouldn't I?
