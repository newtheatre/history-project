    quote: "I loved the atmosphere created by the starkness of the set and the feel these two actors emitted. You may have missed out on this excellent performance but there is more to come from the Nottingham New Theatre"

Joey loves his job. He follows the law to the letter and wants to see the justice in every case. Denny, on the other hand, just loves his life. He drinks and smokes on the job and believes you can use any means necessary to get what you want. Theyâ€™ve policed the darkest streets of Chicago for the last twenty years and are as close as brothers. But when one pursuit of justice almost shatters their careers, Joey and Denny find themselves embroiled in a personal battle with potentially harrowing consequences.
