After exile for twelve years on a mysterious island, Prospero conjures a tempest, shipwrecking the King of Naples and Antonio (his treacherous brother). Three subplots ensue: Prospero, with the help of spirit-servant Ariel, orchestrates a budding romance between his daughter, Miranda, and the King of Naples’ son, Ferdinand. Antonio and Sebastian conspire to kill Alonso and Gonzalo, whilst elsewhere Caliban, Prospero’s slave monster, plots with Stephano (the drunken butler) and Trinculo (the mischevous court jester) to kill Prospero. This highly physical and ensemble-based production is a unique and visually striking interpretation of Shakespeare’s final solo play.
