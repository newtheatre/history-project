    quote: "The opening of the play was truly astounding; I was truly mesmerised by the whole mechanical-clockwork actions of the cast that enabled each character to be defined and introduced by a familiar trait without speaking. "

In the Summer of 1922, New York reaches boiling point: the parties are longer, the morals are looser, the liquor is stronger and the jazz is hotter. Nick Carraway, a young Yale graduate and veteran of the First World War, arrives from the Midwest to seek his fortune. He is soon drawn into the decadent, hedonistic world of America’s richest, but when tragedy strikes, Nick is forced to decide whether money matters more to him than his morality. Featuring dance and physical theatre, this is a sharp, vibrant and dynamic new adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written.
