    quote: "Another play that reinforces my love for University theatre productions as they do not shy away from lesser known plays and are not afraid at taking risks. Something that outstanding theatre is based on, and something that bigger theatre groups can't financially take the chance with."

She is a faerie come from the underworld to pursue and entrap the two girls, through time and space, through this world and her own. Come along to the first NNT New Slot production and get ready to experience the weird and wonderful world of The Skriker.
