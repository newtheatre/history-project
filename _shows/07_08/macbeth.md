    quote: "Whether Banquo’s ghost is a frequenter at your dinner parties, or you couldn’t care less if you saw a dagger before you – this production of Macbeth will give you a Shakespeare infusion that will leave you wanting more (which is convenient; because you can then go home and read the complete version)."

A one hour powerhouse production of the classic take of ambition, power, murder and madness. From the only student-run theatre in England, The New Theatre. In association with Ankle Productions winners of the National Student Drama Festival and an Edinburgh Festival Sell-Out company.
