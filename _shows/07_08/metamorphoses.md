Mary Zimmermann's play Metamorphoses is a funky, modern take on nine original Greek myths as assembled by Ovid. Whether it is Eros getting it on with Psyche, Phaeton moaning to his therapist about his dad Apollo, or Poseidon unleashing "one enormous green catastrophe", the stories will be familiar, with element of comedy and romance as well as tragedy, surrounding the central theme of change - metamorphoses. This is supported through a pool forming the centre of the stage and underlining the changes within the individual stories, by making use of the element of water. And remember, everything will be good as long as the gods are pleased.
