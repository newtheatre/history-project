One of Jean-Paul Sartre's most ground-breaking works delving into ideas of self-deception and human responsibility. Three characters from socially disparate backgrounds find themselves in Sartre's unique perception of hell. What follows is a tense and dramatic depiction of possibly the cruellest form of torture - the human imagination. Each of the characters soon realise that they themselves are the instruments of hell, and it is each other who will force them to reveal their deepest and darkest secrets.
