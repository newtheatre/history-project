Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead is both a comedy and a tragedy that focuses on the story of the two neglected courtiers in Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. With the action of Hamlet colliding regularly with their own story, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern struggle to see why they are there, what they're doing and who they really are before it is too late.
