Salesman Willy Loman is in a crisis. A slave to the capitalist system for so many years in continuous search of achieving the American dream, he is about to lose his job. He can't pay his bills, his sons don't respect him, and he never realised his potential. He wonders what went wrong and how he can make things up to his family.
