    quote: "Crave is a very different production, short and intense. It looks at what life and love ‘does’ to people through four characters, known only by letters and each tortured by their own personal traumas."

Set in an unnamed city from which voices and images spring, Crave charts the disintegration of a human mind under the pressures of love, loss and desire. Four nameless characters tell their tales, with poetic dialogues that meet, converge and move apart with balletic grace.
