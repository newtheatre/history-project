    quote: "Like all club nights, the audience was eventually chucked out into the cold night to postmortem the evening. Verdict? While Shakers social comment had more power to shake up itâ€™s audience, but the greater pace and lightness of Bouncers had more bounce."

Two hilarious pieces of theatre which speak to "a generation of clubbers". Bouncers & Shakers focuses on four misunderstood doormen, four weary cocktail waitresses and their rowdy customers, following them through the glitz and glamour of a nightclub. "Absorbing, yet revealing, modern comedy! You'll laugh until they throw you out!"
