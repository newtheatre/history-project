    quote: "The subtle staging and use of haunting film reels, picturing lonely train stations and a deserted beach, were used to great effect and added to the eerie sense of alienation which is never far from the surface in this play which grapples with what it means to be an individual. Strikingly successful in both its writing and its execution, Under the Impression made a very good impression indeed."

Jacob has hit a wall in his work. Frustratingly unable to complete a short story, he embarks on a desperate search for inspiration. However, as his personal pursuit for insight gains ground, Jacob finds himself increasingly alienated from the people around him. Despite this, he sees a conclusion in sight, although it's not quite what he had imagined...
