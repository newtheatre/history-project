    quote: "The subtle staging and use of haunting film reels, picturing lonely train stations and a deserted beach, were used to great effect and added to the eerie sense of alienation which is never far from the surface in this play which grapples with what it means to be an individual. Strikingly successful in both its writing and its execution, Under the Impression made a very good impression indeed."
