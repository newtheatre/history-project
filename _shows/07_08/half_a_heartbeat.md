    quote: "This charming and original story, from the pen of first-time playwright and self-confessed Dungeons and Dragons fan RJ, is wonderfully endearing thanks to the likeable characters created by its small cast."

In essence this is a romantic tale with a twist. "A lively and captivating production, skilfully performed by a very talented cast of nine... Pure enjoyment."

The play was created by last year's National Student Drama Festival's comedy award winning team.
