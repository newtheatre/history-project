The pilgrimage tradition is turned on its head in this spectacular production as two jaded American women take a trip to India. Plagued by their pasts, Katherine Brynne and Margaret Civil travel the length and breath of the country looking to 'heal' their souls. In their adventures, they are accompanied by none other than the elephant-headed God, Ganesh! Fluid in his guises, he appears before them in different forms-from a Japanese tourist to a leper-until a breathtaking release arrives for both women at his hands.
