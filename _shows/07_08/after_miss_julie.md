1945 and as the Labour Party rise to victory in the general election, Miss Julie is busy in her family mansion's kitchen; drunk and seducing her father's chauffeur. Sexual power becomes a weapon as the characters carve into the tension in an attempt to break out of their class, status and gender.

It's the first play of the season guys, and a really good chance to see some of New Theatre's most faithful before they disappear off to drama school! Let's really start the new season with a full house!!
