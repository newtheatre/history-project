    title: "After Miss Julie @ New Theatre"

    quote: "This is a challenging play to perform, because of its intensity and the sudden changes in emotion throughout. The cast successfully captures this and the puzzle of the true nature of John and Julieâ€™s feelings, influenced and hindered by class and position. Even as they profess their love and try and convince each other to escape to New York, the mistress servant relationship remains."

1945 and as the Labour Party rise to victory in the general election, Miss Julie is busy in her family mansion's kitchen; drunk and seducing her father's chauffeur. Sexual power becomes a weapon as the characters carve into the tension in an attempt to break out of their class, status and gender.

It's the first play of the season guys, and a really good chance to see some of New Theatre's most faithful before they disappear off to drama school! Let's really start the new season with a full house!!
