The average time it takes for the emergency services to respond to a collision, Seven Minutes Thirty-one explores the moments immediately after a car crash all the way up to the eventual arrival of the police. The play tackles the thoughts and feelings of each character involved with the incident, from the driver's recollection and regret to the desensitisation of events from emergency response teams. An exciting and fresh piece of drama which will challenge and provoke both actor and audience.
