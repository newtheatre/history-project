    quote: "The newly formed improv group (SIN) has created a play which proves a great showcase for the inventiveness and individuality of its performers while also maintaining a distinctive brand of dark and pleasingly cartoonish humour which unites the production."

Do you like murder, intrigue and suspense? Do you like to control events and imagine yourself as some sort of all-powerful demi-God? If so then we think you might enjoy this...

Student Improv Nottingham presents an intriguing twist upon the classic murder-mystery; an unfinished tale, governed not by reason or logic, but YOU, the audience. Part written, part improvised, you decide the culprit - and then we improvise the rest.

A gripping story, replete with lonely soliloquies, clueless characters and gaping plotholes, The Cranberry Chamber promises to be a compelling comic caper, deadly fun for all the family or co-habiting student household.

Who dunnit? You decide...
