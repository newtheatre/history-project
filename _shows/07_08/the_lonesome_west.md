    quote: "This farce is delivered so ruthlessly by Ed Hancockâ€™s Bernard Black-esque Irish misanthrope that you will feel like converting to Catholicism just for the fun of the guilt."

The play combines manic energy and physical violence in a way that is both hilarious and viscerally exciting" - "Daily Telegraph". Valene and Coleman, two brothers living alone in their father's house after his recent death, find it impossible to exist without the most massive and violent disputes over the most mundane and innocent of topics. Only father Welsh, the local young priest, is prepared to try to reconcile the two before their petty squabblings spiral into vicious and bloody carnage.
