The Breakfast Club is a 1985 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film written, produced, and directed by John Hughes.

The storyline follows five teenagers, each a member of a different high school clique, who spend a Saturday in detention together and come to realize that they are all more than their respective stereotypes, while facing a villainous principal.

Critics consider it one of the greatest high school films, as well as one of Hughes' most memorable and recognizable works.
