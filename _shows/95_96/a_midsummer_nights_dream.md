  - quote: "It was indeed performed outside in the Quad. I had 3 lots of lines in the Play. The first and second were 1 line only, but the last was 4 lines. On the last night of the Play, I remembered all my lines, but on the third set, the 3rd and fourth went out of my head completely, so of course I made them up. Making up lines from a Shakespeare Play-what a sin! But I asked my friend Sian if she noticed anything and she said 'No, you were good.'"

A Midsummer Night's Dream is a comedy play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1590 and 1596. It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of the Duke of Athens, Theseus, and Hippolyta. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors (mechanicals), who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world.
