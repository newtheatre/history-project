trivia:
  - quote: Design for this production involved the creation of a distorted domestic interior, which initially needed to be cluttered with objects, could slowly be removed to leave a gloomy, empty interior.  The starkness of the finalised design needed to reflect the main character’s tormented existential searching, with walls which appeared to close in as well as act as a blank canvas to his words of written poetry.
