We Need to Talk About Mary takes place at a slumber party, in which five
school friends, now aged 25, come back together for a reunion. Little do
they know that the shadow of their past lingers over them, and tonight it
will finally catch up. In between wine, memories and truth or dare, the
friends soon discover that Mary, an even older friend who most have
forgotten, has other plans for their evening. We Need to Talk About Mary
tells the story of growing up, exploring love, loss and secrets, all with a little
twist of the supernatural.
