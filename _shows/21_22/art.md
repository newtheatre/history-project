Serge has bought a modern work of art for a large sum of money; a white canvas with a few faint lines. Marc hates the painting and cannot believe that a friend of his could possibly want to purchase such a piece of ‘art’. But does he hate the painting or Serge’s independent thought? 

Yvan attempts, unsuccessfully, to mediate between both sides with hilarious consequences. The question is: Are you who you think you are or are you who your friends think you are? 

'Art' follows the dynamic of three friends whose tensions run much deeper than just the purchase of a painting.
