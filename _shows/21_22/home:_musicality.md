A beautifully complicated bunch of adolescents meet in a group therapy session who
 live for love without counting the cost; each character opens up about their past struggles surrounding relationships with others, whether this is with ex-partners, friends or family. ‘Home’ tells the story of lost souls yearning for a soulmate and attempting
 to better themselves to be more loveable, but as the show goes on, the characters learn to love themselves instead and discover their soulmates are the friends that they meet along the journey
