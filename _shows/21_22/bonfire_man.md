Dark and Surreal character comedy from rising star Ben Macpherson. This live mockumentary takes you to the heart of the Nevada desert for a look at a festival that’s similar but legally distinct from another desert based festival/event with the initials B M. This vivid sketch show has toured across the UK delighting audiences with a blend of character, clowning sketch comedy. 

You can expect absurd characters, shocking revelations and a bizarre look at how community can light a fire in someones heart. “Like an optimistic League of Gentleman.” 

PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE GIANT LIZARD, he’s trying to run a tech company. 

The show is structured as a series of monologues, responses to questions from the documentary maker. These are gathered over the week he spends at the festival getting to the heart of why this community cares so much about the Bonfire Man so much? As his documentary unfolds conspiracy theories surface, organised crime pops up in the cashless society and we find out the exact feelings of a twenty-metre-tall wooden effigy as it is set on fire.
