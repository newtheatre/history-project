'The Importance of Being Earnest' is the most renowned of Oscar Wilde's comedies. It's the story of two bachelors, John 'Jack' Worthing and Algernon 'Algy' Moncrieff, who create alter egos named Earnest to escape their tiresome lives. They attempt to win the hearts of the two women who, conveniently, claim to only love men called Earnest. The pair struggle to keep up with their own stories and become tangled in a tale of deception, disguise and misadventure. The elaborate plot ridicules Victorian sensibilities with some of the best loved, and indeed bizarre characters to be found on the modern stage.
