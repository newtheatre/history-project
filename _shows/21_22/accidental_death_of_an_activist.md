Three police officers have made false statements about an incident that
led to the unlawful death of a Black man in the street. The Maniac, a serial
impersonator, discovers the details of the crime and impersonates a
visiting judge who was being sent to review the case. The Maniac takes the
three officers through a loop, tricking them into not only confessing but
incriminating themselves further. Accidental death of an activist focuses
on the recent Black lives matter movement and the systematic injustice of the modern age. Inspired by Dario Fo’s “the accidental death of an
anarchist”.
