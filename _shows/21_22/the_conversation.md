A short preview of one of the Nottingham New Theatre shows performing at Edinburgh Festival Fringe this year.  The Conversation explores the disparities that non-European international students have when moving to the United Kingdom for university. A silent obstacle that every international student confronts involves the lack of community and the jarring cultural differences that lead to inevitable loneliness. Set in a bare lounge area of a student accommodation, a conversation takes place between A, B and C. This conversation plays out from the perspective of C, an Asian international student. What seemed to be an ordinary, innocent conversation about personalities develops to show the condescending, misconstrued and harmful methods of understanding cultures.
