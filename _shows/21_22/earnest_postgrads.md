Presented by Post-Graduate New Theatre (PGNT), the importance of being Earnest is one of Wilde’s most famous play. It is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to escape burdensome social obligations. 

Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways.

The story revolves around two bachelors, John ‘Jack’ Worthing and Algernon ‘Algy’ Moncrieff, who created alter egos named Earnest to escape their tiresome lives. They attempt to win the hearts of two women
who, conveniently, claim to only love men called Earnest. The pair struggle to keep up with their own stories and become tangled in a tale of deception, disguise and misadventure.
