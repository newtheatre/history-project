Based (VERY loosely) on the classic novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. If you
think you know the story of ‘Jekyll & Hyde’, you’re probably right. This, however, is not that story.

Jekyll’s your typical Victorian gent: Stylish lifestyle, high-profile friends, a
few shillings in his pocket, one sugar in his tea. He just can’t seem to get
his research approved. So, he bites the bullet and experiments on himself, and accidentally gives himself another personality.

And another. And another.

As the death count rises, events spiral out of control and unlikely friends
are made, can Jekyll work out a way to correct his mistake and get his life
back on track, all while keeping the murderous Hyde, demanding Hilda and tumultuous Martin from driving him mad?
Today might be a four sugar day.
