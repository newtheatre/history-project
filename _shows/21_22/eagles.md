Dorota returns to the flat she grew up in to visit her ageing mother, Bosia, and sell an inherited flat. As always, nothing has chnaged, down to Bosia's incessant nagging, and though the place and its memories bring her pain, she is determined to understand the past and how their picture-perfect family unravelled the way it did. Over the course of an evening, the two women are plunged back through memories of blissful childhood in the Polish People's Republic, breathtaking love, and dreams of the glorious and promising 'West'. What also comes to haunt is guilt and regret, as the ghosts of her father and brother loom large. Dorota stands at a crossroads in her own life and must decide how to acknowledge these regrets, without letting them hold her in their clutches. A winding family tale, meditating on freedom, sacrifice, and the choices we make, featuring the sights and ssounds of a unique time in history
