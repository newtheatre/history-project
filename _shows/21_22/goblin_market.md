Two sisters, Laura and Lizzie, are happily living their simple life when a childhood story their mother told them becomes a reality. Goblins, strange mystical creatures that are known to be cunning tricksters. They sell their furit to anyone who is interested but the price paid for the delicious goods is far greater than the coin. Laura and Lizzie learn this lesson the hard way. Laura, cursed by the fruit, waits at death's door as her sister Lizzie does all she can to save her. A retelling of Christina Rosetti's poem Goblin Market, this show retells the famous piece through physical and abstract theatre.
