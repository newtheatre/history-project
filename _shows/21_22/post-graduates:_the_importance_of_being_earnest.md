Presented by Post-Graduate New Theatre (PGNT), the importance of being Earnest is one of Wilde’s most famous play. It is a
farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to
escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social
conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the
triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the
resulting satire of Victorian ways.
The story revolves around two bachelors, John ‘Jack’ Worthing and
Algernon ‘Algy’ Moncrieff, who created alter egos named Earnest to
escape their tiresome lives. They attempt to win the hearts of two women
who, conveniently, claim to only love men called Earnest. The pair struggle
to keep up with their own stories and become tangled in a tale of
deception, disguise and misadventure.
