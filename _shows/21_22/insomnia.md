Bodie is in her last few months of 6th form; exam dates are approaching, and the expectations of her grades are high. But then Bodie gets sick – she is burnt out and constantly tired. A tiredness so bad that even deep sleep can’t fix it. But despite feeling exhausted, she is also unable to fall asleep when she needs to. 

Bodie isn’t just sick – she is suffering from insomnia.

Insomnia isn’t just lying awake at night without feeling tired. Insomnia is loneliness. Insomnia is nightmares, and emotional instability; the feeling of your bones aching to whole new levels, and limbs feeling like they’re sinking into the ground. Insomnia is depression.


How does Bodie deal with the crippling depression and strong grasp of exhaustion as she moves between 6th form and first year of university?
