Sometimes, an idea forms that is so incredible, so ground-breaking, so unbelievable that others feel the need to strike it down. This is not one of those ideas.

In other cases, an idea forms that make people say 'that's really funny, but we can't possibly do it'.

Thankfully, Nick and Olly have been keeping a list of those ideas over the years, and so finally they can be presented to the world (or at the very least, a small audience at a student theatre).

Welcome to 'Vetoed', we hope you don't entirely despise your stay.
