Ever wished that your dreams were as vivid as real life? That you could remember every word? Control every detail? Maya did. That’s why she started taking dream pills. They were everything she’d hoped for and more. 

They were an escape. 

They made her dreams come to life. But when reality comes knocking and collides with Maya’s fantasy, her life spirals out of control. She loses her job, her happiness, and the love of her life. Torn between two worlds, Maya must choose whether to come back to reality, or descend further into her fantasy. That is, if she has a choice.
