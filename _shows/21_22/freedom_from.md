V, in the familiar setting of their studio apartment during a self-isolation, uncovers a number of unnerving truths. As they begin to give in to intrusive thoughts, they explore their biggest fears, desires, memories and phenomenological experiences questioning all things essential and existential. Through the mediums of physical theatre, videography and installation art, the limits of theatrical expression are pushed to communicate Vâ€™s journey in recreating a self identity and exploring the apparent contradictions of reality and perception.
