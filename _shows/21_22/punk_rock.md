William Carlisle has the world at his feet but its weight on his shoulders. He is intelligent, articulate and f\*cked. In the library of a fee-paying grammar school, William and his fellow Sixth-Formers are preparing for their mock A-Levels while navigating the pressures of teenage life. They are educated and aspirational young people, but step-by-step, the dislocation, disjunction and latent aggression is revealed.
