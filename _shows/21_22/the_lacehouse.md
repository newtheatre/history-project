A short preview of one of the Nottingham New Theatre shows performing at Edinburgh Festival Fringe this year. 

Wanna see a real Greek tragedy? Three sisters. Three prized possessions. One crystal ball. The night before their father’s funeral, the sisters hold a seance to locate the possessions of their deceased parents, immigrants from Cyprus who left for the UK and its promises. One problem – each sister is hiding what they truly want. Where is the will? Who has the veil? Who else knows about the hidden letter? From dances with the dead to sibling rivalries, each sister must face their reckoning in the wake of those passed on, and secrets that refuse to stay buried.
