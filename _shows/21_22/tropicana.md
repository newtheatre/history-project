Hot off the back of their sold out Edinburgh Fringe run, join non binary cabaret performer Aidan Sadler as they take you on a journey through their upbringing in a small industrial town, set against a backdrop of 80s synth-pop nostalgia and punctuated with world class stand-up comedy.

Nothing is safe from ridicule, so join Aidan on an exploration of body image, hetronormativity and the dreaded ASOS gays. Tropicana explores, bends and abuses the gender binary on a backdrop of electrifying 80s hits from Spandau Ballet to ABC.
