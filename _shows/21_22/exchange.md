It is widely assumed that satire is dead. Public figures make such a joke of themselves that there is no point in mocking them. I beg to differ. Exchange explores the bizarre situations that politicians find themselves in, and why it's a necessity to continue taking the piss; not just for our democracy, but for our sanity.
