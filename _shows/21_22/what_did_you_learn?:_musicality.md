The plot focuses on 6 teenagers on the evening of their last day of summer camp. A camp councillor has asked the mismatched group “what did you learn” while at camp. The group, clearly all a little too old for summer camp, each take turns answering the question, with each song exploring their answers and letting us learn about each camper, their lives and relationships.
