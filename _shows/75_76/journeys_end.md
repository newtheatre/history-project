trivia:
  - quote: At the end of the show, before the dugout set partially collapses, there were one or two maroon explosions. These were quite nasty explosives that were fired in an old water tank. As they were expensive we couldn’t waste them during rehearsals so as Stage Manager I would shout ‘MAROON’ to signify the explosion. For several years afterwards when I met cast and crew the opening of the conversation was for someone to shout “maroon”.

  - quote: The show needed a number of dummy rifles and Hugh Simon had arranged to hire these from Baptys, a well known armourer to film, tv and theatre, based on Harrow Rd, London. Hugh and I drove to London in my decrepit Daf to pick up these fake guns. I recall driving up and down Harrow Road for over an hour looking for Baptys, which due to their line of business was not well advertised. After we found them, we were taken to the back of their yard past armourers firing very loud automatic weapons into sandbags. Driving back to Nottingham with a boot full of even dummy guns seemed a slightly dangerous thing to do given the situation in Ireland.

Journey's End is a 1928 drama, the seventh of English playwright R. C. Sherriff.

Set in the trenches near Saint-Quentin, Aisne, in 1918 towards the end of the First World War, Journey's End gives a glimpse into the experiences of the officers of a British Army infantry company in World War I. The entire story plays out in the officers' dugout over four days from 18 March 1918 to 21 March 1918, during the run-up to the real-life events of Operation Michael.

Sherriff considered calling it "Suspense" and "Waiting", but eventually found a title in the closing line of a chapter of an unidentified book: "It was late in the evening when we came at last to our journey's end."
