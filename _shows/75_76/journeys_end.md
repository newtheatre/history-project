Journey's End is a 1928 drama, the seventh of English playwright R. C. Sherriff.

Set in the trenches near Saint-Quentin, Aisne, in 1918 towards the end of the First World War, Journey's End gives a glimpse into the experiences of the officers of a British Army infantry company in World War I. The entire story plays out in the officers' dugout over four days from 18 March 1918 to 21 March 1918, during the run-up to the real-life events of Operation Michael.

Sherriff considered calling it "Suspense" and "Waiting", but eventually found a title in the closing line of a chapter of an unidentified book: "It was late in the evening when we came at last to our journey's end."
