    quote: "Disastrous Dates was in turn hilarious, fascinating and down-right awkward. It kept the audience rapt for the duration, which was just as long as it needed to be. A showcase of real comedic talent in acting, writing and directing and an excellent second show in the New Theatreâ€™s external season."
