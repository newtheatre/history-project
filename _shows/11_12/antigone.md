In the pub ‘The Fate’s Thread’ in modern day Thebes, all is not well. Both heirs have slain act other on the battlefield. Eteocles will be honoured – Polyneices will be left to the crows. But their sister, Antigone, has her part to play before the day is done, whilst the Landlord and the regulars watch on.
