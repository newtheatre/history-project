    quote: "Of course, no production is perfect. Sure, the lengthy gaps between scenes became a little tedious (though this may well have been intended to add to the measured, repetitive tone), and the naturalistic mode of delivery sometimes meant that Wellsâ€™ comic quips were lost. Nevertheless, this is definitely one of the best plays I have seen at the New Theatre."
