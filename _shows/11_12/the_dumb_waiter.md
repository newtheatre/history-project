Two hit-men sit in a dingy, disused basement kitchen, waiting.  As they await instructions about their next job from a mysterious higher authority, their surroundings become stranger by the minute, and tensions rise until the play reaches its harrowing climax.

Hilarious, sharp and deeply unsettling, The Dumb Waiter is Pinter at his absolute best.
