    quote: "If things are feeling all a bit too serious right now, I would highly recommend a trip down to New Theatre to lose yourself in some light-hearted tomfoolery. It’s hard to worry about exams when all you actually care about is the mystery of The 39 Steps."

When a mysterious spy is murdered in his apartment, Richard Hannay embarks on a quest to clear his name and save the country. Encountering over a hundred characters (all portrayed by only four performers), this fast-paced, comedic adaptation of Hitchcock’s classic both charms and excites.
