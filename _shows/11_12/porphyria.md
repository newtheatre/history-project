    quote: "This is a play which, like a dream, promises much and comes tantalisingly close to delivering. The cast give nuanced performances, there is some clever writing, and the Rubiks-cube-like set is a treat."

    quote: "However, more than anything, it is an interesting foray into the nature of dreams, and what can become of people who enter into them. Reginald’s dreams end up costing more than either the dream woman or his wife could realise but, as Deleuze once said, ‘If you’re trapped in the dream of the other, you’re fucked’."

Every night Reginald Blake dreams about his fantasy woman, a woman that is not his wife. One morning he awakes to find this fantasy has come to life and is eating breakfast in his kitchen.
