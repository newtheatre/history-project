    quote: "The Hand-Me-Down People is lacking something in every respect. It feels like Wells just didn’t try to leap from the shelf, and wrote a very safe play that already feels resigned to being left on someone’s shelf, never to be picked up, read, and loved."

    quote: "Writing is strong and multi-layered. A music box playing a never-changing selecion of tunes not only frustrates her fellow shelf-dwellers, but underscores the limbo they find themselves in."

Ignored and abandoned on a dusty shelf, a group of outdated figurines await the inevitable. An allegorical and humorous tale about growing older.
