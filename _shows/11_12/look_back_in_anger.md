‘I learnt at an early age what it was to be angry – angry and helpless.’

Jimmy Porter is angry. He cannot understand the world around him and feels trapped in it, neither going forwards nor backwards. He takes out his anger on his wife, Alison, and their friend and flatmate, Cliff, but Alison is pregnant and tired of Jimmy’s behaviour. It’s not long before he realises how much he needs her and just how vulnerable he is. John Osborne’s classic angst piece returns to the stage in this exciting revival.
