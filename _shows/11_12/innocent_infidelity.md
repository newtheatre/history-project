    quote: "Wilmann has succeeded in creating an engrossing play in which the audience is given free rein to their imagination and are encouraged to reflect on the nature and outcome of infidelity and in this respect the play certainly does not disappoint."

Reg is sleeping with Julia behind Hilary’s back but he’s doing nothing wrong. Julia only exists in his imagination. She is literally his dream woman. So, when Reg comes home one night to find Julia in his house, speaking to Hilary, his world is plunged into chaos and confusion.
