In rural Ireland, a manipulative elderly mother attempts to sabotage her daughter's first and last chance for love, driving her to desperate and brutal extremes. With a rare ability to provoke laughter in the darkest of moments, this biting black comedy perfectly balances the fine line between horror and hilarity.
