    quote: "With a mix of established and devised monologues, the cast successfully showcased a variety of different styles, comic and tragic, switching between conversational and physical theatre pieces. Tread Softly signals a change of direction for the New Theatre and definitely demonstrates exciting things to come in the external season."
