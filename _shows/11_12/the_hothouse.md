    quote: "My voice is muted, however, because in line with Pinter’s claim that ‘We don’t need critics to tell the audience what to think’, the natural vitality, effortless comedy and thought provoking satire of The Hothouse truly speaks for itself."

At once fantastically dark and hilarious, 'The Hothouse' takes place in a Sanatorium overseen by a shadowy organisation called the Ministry. Shown only from the point of view of the staff, Pinter's sharp intelligence highlights the ridiculousness of arbitrary authority and explores the corrupting influence of ultimate power over another human being.
