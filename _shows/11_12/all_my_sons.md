    quote: "Director Dave Porter claimed in the programme, that this was a tragedy “of the human soul” and “it was of utmost importance to me to do justice to it” and as I left the theatre, still numb with the thrilling emotion of sorrow, I was convinced that he certainly had done just that."

Ohio, August, 1947. Joe Keller, a middle-aged businessman, sits in his garden with his family and neighbours, relaxing in his little piece of the American Dream. But the ghosts of his past are circling, ready to bring his world crashing around his ears. Arthur Miller's first classic brims with tension, poetry and emotional intensity.

Cast: 5 male, 5 female.
