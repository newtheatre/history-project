Ohio, August, 1947. Joe Keller, a middle-aged businessman, sits in his garden with his family and neighbours, relaxing in his little piece of the American Dream. But the ghosts of his past are circling, ready to bring his world crashing around his ears. Arthur Miller's first classic brims with tension, poetry and emotional intensity.

Cast: 5 male, 5 female.
