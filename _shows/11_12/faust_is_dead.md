    quote: "The performances effectively operate the play’s intention of pushing theatrical conventions of ‘what can be displayed’. In doing so it charts our fetishized escape from consciousness, and the half-virtual exploration of our darkest impulses."

Elena announces ‘the Death of Man’ live on Letterman’s TV show. Pete can’t cope with the world without the comfort of a screen to frame it. The pair meet and find reality in a twisted world of disturbing social media. Both funny and brutal in equal measure. #isanythingrealanymore?
