Louise wakes up alone with a work colleague, Mark, in his nuclear fallout shelter.
He explains the destruction caused above them by a nuclear bomb, and how he carried her here, where they’ll have to remain for two weeks.
It’s imperative that they find a way to get along. However, Louise really doesn’t want to play Dungeons and Dragons…

…but Mark is going to have to insist.
