===== Synopsis =====

A haunted war photographer hides at the end of a deserted fairground pier, surrounded only by her collection of postcards and memories of the Bosnian war zone.
A snapshot of a forgotten cafe in Eastern Europe, deserted of life.
A stain to be erased.
A shadow in the doorway.
And a visitor to be faced.
Smile for the camera. Smile. If you can.
