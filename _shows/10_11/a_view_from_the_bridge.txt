===== Synopsis =====

“I was just thinking before, comin’ home, suppose my father didn’t come to this country, and I was starving like them over there … and I had people in America could keep me for a couple of months? The man would be honoured to lend me a place to sleep.”
Eddie Carbone, a poor longshoreman, lives with his wife Beatrice and niece Catherine in 1950s New York. Living out the 'American Dream' their world is rocked by the arrival of two illegal immigrant cousins Marco and Rodolpho. Tensions soar, and Alfieri a local lawyer, along with the audience, sit powerless and watch it 'run its bloody course.'
A View From the Bridge is a highly charged dramatic play about romance, jealousy, betrayal and the 'American Dream'.
