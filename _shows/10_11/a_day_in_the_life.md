    quote: "What may sound like a complex and confluent production was constructed with such ease and causality we were amazed with the quality of the show, astounded that this was all improvised. With the collaboration of the cast synchronised with the lighting and band improvisations the fluid production of the entire evening was nothing but impressive."
