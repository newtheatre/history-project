"It seemed to me that the chill he had placed in my soul had finally thawed. I had not reckoned on feeling that chill again so soon…”

Dr. Justus Wehner is a young, precocious lawyer who has been given the opportunity of his career – sent to Düsseldorf to defend the notorious and now incarcerated Peter Kürten, he begins to lose sight of himself as he acquires an uneasy empathy for the bloodier recesses of his client’s mind.

‘Normal’ traces the uneasy relationship developed between Peter Kürten, Dr. Wehner and Eva Kürten whilst unravelling Kürten’s brutal, abusive and deprived childhood in dour provincial Germany, asking the question – “Do we bear monsters, or do we create them?”
