An exciting showcase of new student writing at your very own student run theatre. Go places you've never been. See things you've never seen. Please leave your hallucinogenics and exam stress at the door...

While we can't guarantee bloodsports, a live sex show or a surprise appearance from Bob Dylan, it'll probably be a more stimulating evening than all that put together.
