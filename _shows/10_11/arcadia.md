"When we have found all the mysteries and lost all the meanings, we will be alone, on an empty shore"

April 1809, a stately home in Derbyshire… Under the watchful eye of her tutor Septimus, Thomasina, a gifted pupil, proposes a startling theory beyond her comprehension. All the while scandal emerges as the secret desires and illicit passions of the adults are stirred by the arrival of one Lord Byron.

In the very same room two hundred years later, popular historian Hannah and university don Bernard are piecing together puzzling clues, curiously recalling those events of 1809, in their quest to uncover the scandal invoked by Lord Byron’s presence at Sidley Park.
