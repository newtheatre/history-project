“This is an extraordinary city. It's a city that you should see primarily at nighttime. It is becomes more concentrated at nighttime. We could take a look at it for a while...”
Failed novelist Jimmy Macneill drives a London minicab, ferrying around the weird and wonderful characters who inhabit the city. In lending an ear to their tragic tales, he attempts to bury the story of his own past.
Bluebird is an urban drama about the disparate horrors and delights of living in a city that comes to life at night-time.
