    quote: "Becky Catlin has brought a beautiful piece of writing to the New Theatre stage with precision and style, lifting the characters to the forefront of the production.  Compelling and strangely beautiful, this production of Simon Stephens’ Bluebird made for a thoroughly enjoyable evening at the theatre."

“This is an extraordinary city. It's a city that you should see primarily at nighttime. It is becomes more concentrated at nighttime. We could take a look at it for a while...”
Failed novelist Jimmy Macneill drives a London minicab, ferrying around the weird and wonderful characters who inhabit the city. In lending an ear to their tragic tales, he attempts to bury the story of his own past.
Bluebird is an urban drama about the disparate horrors and delights of living in a city that comes to life at night-time.
