A haunted war photographer hides at the end of a deserted fairground pier, surrounded only by her collection of postcards and memories of the Bosnian war zone.

A snapshot of a forgotten cafe in Eastern Europe, deserted of life.

A stain to be erased.

A shadow in the doorway.

And a visitor to be faced.

Smile for the camera. Smile. If you can.
