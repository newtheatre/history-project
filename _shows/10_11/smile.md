    quote: "The only flaw is the all too complicated language, which is sometimes at odds with the ultra-realistic form of the play. The poetry of the words works better in the broken English of the man than in the rushed, not always intelligible, comments of the woman. The great story and ditto acting donâ€™t need such linguistic gymnastics."

A haunted war photographer hides at the end of a deserted fairground pier, surrounded only by her collection of postcards and memories of the Bosnian war zone.

A snapshot of a forgotten cafe in Eastern Europe, deserted of life.

A stain to be erased.

A shadow in the doorway.

And a visitor to be faced.

Smile for the camera. Smile. If you can.
