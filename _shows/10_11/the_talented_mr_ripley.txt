===== Synopsis =====

Tom Ripley is a young conman living in 1950s New York. After being confused for someone else, he is sent to Mongibello, Italy to retrieve the rich and lazy Richard Greenleaf. Instead of completing his task, Ripley slowly but surely integrates himself into Rickie's life. After becoming obsessed with everything Rickie has (except for his girlfriend, Marge), Tom decides to take things into his own hands.
A chilling psychological thriller, The Talented Mr Ripley is adapted from the award-winning book, which also spawned a movie featuring Matt Damon, Jude Law and Cate Blanchett.
