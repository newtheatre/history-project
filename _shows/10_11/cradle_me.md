In the aftermath of an unspeakable, yet avoidable tragedy, the Neill family finds itself torn apart by grief and turning to Daniel, the troubled teenage boy next door for solace.

Daniel’s relationships with the different members of the family drive the plot of what is both a powerful and emotional mediation on grief and the paths it leads us down.

Cradle Me explores the aftermath of tragedy and the implications of burgeoning sexuality, the impact of inaction and the consequences of desire.
