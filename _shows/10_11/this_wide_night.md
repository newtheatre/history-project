    quote: "So if you want an exciting, fast paced, action story of the criminal under classes, this isn’t for you – perhaps try Tool Academy – but what you will get from This Wide Night is a wonderful exploration of an unhealthy dependant relationship, performed expertly, which is guaranteed to pull at the heart strings."
