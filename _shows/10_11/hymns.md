    quote: "Effective, powerful physical theatre in a relatively small performance space with an equally small cast is difficult to come by; however, director Matt Wilks, producer Elin Stenner-Matthews and the entirety of the New Theatre cast, direction, production and tech team of Hymns did a superb and commendable job."
