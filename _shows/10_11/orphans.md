‘I hate violence. It makes me cry. Always has…’

Danny and Helen are having a candlelit dinner in their family home, when Helen’s brother Liam turns up. Covered in blood.

Liam claims to have found a lad on the pavement suffering from multiple stab wounds. Distressed, panicked and bewildered, he hugs the bloody boy.

But as the play unfolds, the identity of this lad and Liam’s account of what happened becomes increasingly more ambiguous…

Disturbing but darkly comic, Orphans is a contemporary 3-hander that will have audiences on the edge of their seats.
