“I don’t know what you think is going to happen, it’s just a bit of rain”

Rachel waits at home for her husband, Mark. She’s going to tell him that she’s leaving him. But severe flooding means Rachel isn’t going anywhere. Throughout the night strangers arrive in unusual and unexplained circumstances, seeking refuge from the storm. As tensions and water levels rise, Mark reveals a secret that will change their... world forever.
