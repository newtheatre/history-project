1941, and the Falcon hotel in Milchester plays host to the brave young men of the RAF and their loved ones. Patricia, wife of the charming and heroic Flight-Lieutenant Teddy Graham arrives to tell him that she is leaving him for her old flame, Hollywood heartthrob Peter Kyle. However, when Teddy and the others are called off on a dangerous night bombing mission and things start to go awry, Patricia struggles to find the right moment to break her news.

In turns gripping, funny, and tragic, Flare Path is an honest and human study of people performing their duty to society and the conflict that entails with love and self-interest.
