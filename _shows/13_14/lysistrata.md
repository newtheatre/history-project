Written by the Greek playwright Aristophanes in 412 BC, Lysistrata is a comedy about the battle of the sexes that ensues when the women of Greece grow tired of the men waging war amongst themselves and decide to take matters into their own hands to bring about peace. This Postgraduate Theatre production is based on Dudley Fitts' American translation, described by the Evening Standard as "a rollicking excursion into impropriety". Contains frequent sexual references.
