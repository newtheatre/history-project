An unwelcome discovery has caused Gary to run from everything his life has become in the last year. He runs straight back to Andy, his estranged best mate, who is living in a smoky haze with his girlfriend Debbie and doing little else.

Over the course of the evening, Gary searches for the best means of escape from the increasing stagnation of life around him.

But first, there's catching up to be done
