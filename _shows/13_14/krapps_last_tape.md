"Just been listening to that stupid bastard I took myself for thirty years ago. Hard to believe I was ever as bad as that.” On his 69th birthday Krapp sits alone in his den huddled over a tape recorder. He prepares to record his reflections of the past year, but first he will listen to a recording he made 30 years earlier. Considered to be his most autobiographical work, Samuel Beckett’s one-man play tells the moving story of a man surrounded by fragments of his past selves, but doomed to endure his present silence in isolation.
