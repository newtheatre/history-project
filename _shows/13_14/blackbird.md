At his workplace, 55-year-old Ray is shocked to be visited by a young woman, 27-year-old Una. Fifteen years earlier, when Una was only twelve, the two had a sexual affair, for which Ray was arrested and imprisoned. David Harrower's Blackbird is a riveting one-act drama that questions morality and sexuality with a mesmerisingly natural script and two characters brimming with explosive emotions.
