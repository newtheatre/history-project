    quote: "Overall the play was very engaging and thought provoking. The play’s exploration of the importance of memory in defining a person was particularly interesting, with the flashbacks to their lives before imprisonment giving us peeks into the character’s back grounds, as well as offering tantalising hints of their crimes.  "

A comic tragedy, Conviction tells the story of Zane and Javan: two unhinged cellmates who've lost their memory. Forced by circumstance to cooperate, their sanity tested as they both desperately try to remember who they are, and ultimately why they deserve punishment. But do they really, truly want to remember?
