The Nottingham New Theatre and Lakeside Present: DR FAUSTUS By Christopher Marlowe Directed by Martin Berry Running Time: approximately 1hr 20 mins Suitable for 14+ years Djanogly Theatre, Lakeside Faustus is a respected and hugely successful man. He is also doomed by his own hubris, greed and ambition. Bored of logic and mundane life, he makes a pact with the devil: 24 years of unimaginable power in return for his own damnation into hell. One of the original and greatest morality stories, with plenty of laughs along the way. Doctor Faustus and its themes of power and corruption are as relevant today as they were in 1604.
