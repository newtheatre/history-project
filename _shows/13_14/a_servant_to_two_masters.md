    quote: "Whilst I do believe this play could use some improvement, particularly with regard to diction, it was an entertaining night out and I would recommend it to anyone in need of a good laugh."

Lee Hall’s hilarious 21st Century adaptation of Carlo Goldoni’s ‘A Servant to Two Masters’, depicts the quick witted–and perpetually hungry- Truffaldino as he tries to hold down two jobs in order to earn more money and satisfy his growling stomach. However a series of blunders soon snowball into the laugh out loud mayhem only commedia can provide, with this story of love, greed and mistaken identities.
