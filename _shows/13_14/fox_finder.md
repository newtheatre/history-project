Without Man, the Fox will Rule. Dawn King’s tense and atmospheric parable sees William Bloor, a Foxfinder religiously committed to the discovery and destruction of England’s greatest threat, investigate the farm of a recently bereaved couple, Judith and Samuel Covey, for potential infestation and even collaboration.
