“If I don’t go, they’ll take me. To a bad place. I won’t be able to see you. And I want to see you. I want to see that face. My baby’s face.” Our play promises to be incredibly twisted and unashamedly honest. It’s a witty little tour through the lives of unstable people who all make up one fractured family, grudgingly reunited. We see characters compose, combust, step-up and collapse under the strains of kinship. Ultimately, it addresses what exactly it means to be “grown-up”.
