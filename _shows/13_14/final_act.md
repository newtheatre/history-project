Rory is the unfortunate President of the Theatre Society at his University. After a difficult year that supersedes numerous troubled years. Rory is called into the Vice-Chancellor’s office where he is told that the theatre society will be forced to shut down. He is given one last chance to turn things around, his society must put a musical on and it must be a roaring success if he has any hope of saving his society. Love, laughter, betrayal and a few cheesy numbers, accompany Rory on his journey through his University where he hopes to recruit a crack team to produce the best musical he can.
