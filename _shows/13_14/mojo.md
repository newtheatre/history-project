Set against the rock and roll scene of the late 1950’s, Mojo is a ferocious, dark comedy which delves into the sleazy underworld of power hungry gangsters and unhinged youngsters. Club owner Ezra refuses to sell his latest star Silver Johnny to powerful rival Sam Ross. Chaos ensues when a disturbing signal arrives in two dustbins, and Ezra’s right-hand-man Mickey struggles to control his broken brood. Add to the mix Sweets and Potts, two drug addled raconteurs, nervous and skittish Skinny and Ezra’s psychotic son, Baby, and the safe haven of the club soon becomes a claustrophobic ticking time bomb. With virtuosic language and unapologetic masculinity, Mojo is about damaged people and damaged egos. That rock and roll, eh…
