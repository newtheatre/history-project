    quote: "The pace hopped from calm to chaotic countless times. This contrasts with how the play is traditionally performed, whereby it begins with the characters speaking peacefully, but gradually builds into a storm of mayhem, with the characters falling back into the kinds of childlike behaviours for which the sole reason of their meeting was to deter."

"Boys will be boys, but the adults are usually worse- much worse." Yasmina Reza's biting satire God of Carnage depicts a civilised meeting between the Novaks and the Raleighs to discuss the unruly behaviour of their sons. However, this spirals into an evening of tears, tantrums, laughter and chaos through which Reza deftly dissects the bourgeois values of modern society.
