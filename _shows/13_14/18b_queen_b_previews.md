    quote: "18B is a thoughtful, engrossing original piece that is well worthy of thespian lovers and historians alike. It achieves the nigh impossible finding a fictional story (and fictional characters) that are worthy of standing up to a tale as imposing as the Second World War."

    quote: "Queen B wears its heart on its sleeve and dares you not to feel moved, and in a modern world that thrives on sarcasm and mockery I found it refreshing to watch something so honest.  Refreshing, and brave—and I don’t think the cast and crew of this fine show would want it any other way."
