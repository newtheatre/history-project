    quote: " As well as being enjoyable, it calls into question the morals of the bible and the characters within it. I left the theatre undecided as to whether the verdict of Judas’ trial was fair. For me, the mark of an excellent play is leaving the theatre questioning the ending."

Set in a place between Heaven and Hell, where Mother Teresa and Satan sit side-by-side, you have been summoned for jury duty to participate in the sentencing of history’s most notorious betrayer, Judas Iscariot. Fast-paced, witty and controversial ‘The Last Days of Judas Iscariot’ doesn’t settle for simplistic answers but rather explores the violent rupture of relationships between iconic figures in history. Not anti-Christian or anti-Catholic…but you’ll definitely fall in love with the anti-Christ.
