The Rivals by Richard B. Sheridan. We present to you a comedy set in eighteenth-century Bath, where wooers meet in secret, lovers deceive and gouty old men take the health-giving waters. Captain Jack Absolute has a secret identity: by day he is a well-respected military Captain, by night he plays the part of a lowly Ensign called Beverley, in an attempt to entice sufficiently the rich and beautiful Lydia Languish. Lydia has perhaps read too many romance novels in which ladies fall in love with men of humble station. Unfortunately, she also has other suitors, including the bloodthirsty Sir Lucius Oâ€™Trigger, who is spoiling for a duel.
