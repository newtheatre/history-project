In the unrelenting heat of the Italian sun, in fair Verona where we lay our scene, Romeo and Juliet meet at a party. They fall in love. They doom their deaths. Shakespeare's immortal tragedy of star-crossed lovers and warring families us brought to life at The Nottingham New Theatre in all its vibrant and visceral glory. Featuring Shakespeareâ€™s most beautiful romantic poetry, his rudest bawdy and a host of iconic characters and scenes.
