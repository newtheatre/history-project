In the unrelenting heat of the Italian sun, in fair Verona where we lay our scene, Romeo and Juliet meet at a party. They fall in love. They doom their deaths. Shakespeare's immortal tragedy of star-crossed lovers and warring families us brought to life at The Nottingham New Theatre in all its vibrant and visceral glory. Featuring Shakespeare’s most beautiful romantic poetry, his rudest bawdy and a host of iconic characters and scenes.
