The farm is failing to provide any crops and a horrific buried betrayal is tearing the family apart. Describing the disillusionment of the American Dream and the shortcomings of the family members, the play is set in Illinois, where an outsider desires the revelation of the secret, but perhaps some things are better left unsaid.
