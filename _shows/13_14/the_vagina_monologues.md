For one night only, the Women's Network present The Vagina Monologues. The Vagina Monologues is based on the author Eve Ensler’s ‘Vagina Interviews’ conducted with women from all around the world, this hilariously witty and moving collection of tales gives voice to a chorus of lusty, outrageous, poignant, brave and thoroughly human stories. The matinee performance will start at 2pm, with tickets on sale from 1.30pm and the evening performance will begin at 8pm, with tickets from 7.30pm.
