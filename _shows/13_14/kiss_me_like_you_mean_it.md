Its 3am in Manchester and two parties are taking place in a shabby Victorian terrace. Ruth and Tony, both in their twenties, meet in the back garden: their painful flirtation soon becomes a deeply felt exchange about their anxieties, dreams and expectations. Don and Edie are in their late sixties and are having their own private party upstairs: gradually the purpose of their party become apparent. The story follows these two couples through the early morning to sunrise, showing just what the true meaning of love is...
