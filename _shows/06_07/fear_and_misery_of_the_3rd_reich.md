    quote: "Brechtâ€™s touching and profound collection of sketches, portraying the morally defunct and distressing realities of the Nazi regime in Germany, was movingly and cleverly reproduced in the New Theatre."

From Brecht's series of twenty-four interconnected playlets, describing events which took place in ordinary German households in the 1930s. They dramatise with clinical precision the suspicion and anxiety experienced by ordinary people, particular Jewish citizens, as athe power of Hitler grew.
