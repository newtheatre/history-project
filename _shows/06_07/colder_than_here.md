    quote: "At times deeply uncomfortable and at others deliciously entertaining, ‘Colder Than Here’ is a wonderfully moving portrayal of the time between diagnosis and death, showing that even when confronted with the worst, life finds a way to go on."

Nobody can ignore the fact that Myra is dying, but in the meantime life goes on. As a mother researches burial spots and biodegradable coffins, her family is finally forced to communicate with her, and each other, in this character driven play about life, death and everything in between.
