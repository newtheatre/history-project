    quote: "A strong ensemble of actresses playing the sisters, and a genuinely intimidating Bernada make this already excellent play come to life. A must see."

Edward Albee's ground-breaking one-act play - lyrical, abrasive, daring and witty in theme and form. Two strangers meet in Central Park, and the ensuing dialogue, with a shocking ending, brings into question many of the values - family, friendship, security, ownership - that shapes our live.

With ironic humour and unrelenting dramatic suspense, the play explores themes of isolation, loneliness, social disparity and dehumanisation in a commercial world.
