    title: "Mrs. Warrenâ€™s Profession: 19th century Ab-Fab (but with hookers...)"
    date: 2006-11-08
    quote: "Within the confines of time and money restrictions, the production has done what it can towards 19th-century grandeur with successful costuming, and a suggestion of the Victorian world in which the action is played out."

"Shocking" plays from the Victorian era often don't seem that shocking ot modern audiencs, but who wouldn't be shoked to find out htat not only is their mother a prostitute, they could be engaged to their own brother? A witty and hard hitting play about the world's oldest profession that was banned for 35 years. The cast includes a sleazy vicar, a turn of the century pimp , the most unromatnic heroine you've ever seen, and of course, Mrs Warren herself.
