Reflections of an inverted Cinderella in the murky waters of London - fairytales Dickens never forgot lurk behind this classic story full of colourful characters. A mysterious fortune bestowed on an orphan; the snobbish rejection of true friends for the cold affections of a shadow of a girl; rich comedy juxtaposed with the violent and heartless side of human nature - this is the classic tale of Pip's haunted path to true maturity. Retaining the delicate detail of one of Dickens' greatest novels, this fresh and challenging adaptation fuses beautiful imagery and poignant music behind heart-warmingly real performances. New Theatre is the University of Nottinghamâ€™s student run drama society. In association with stateoftheart productions.
