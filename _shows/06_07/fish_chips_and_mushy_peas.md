Fish, Chips and Mushy Peas is essentailly a leap twenty years into the future, right here in the UK. A look at how far popular culture and politics could have moved; it examines the idea of reality TV in determining whether contestants may gain British citizenship. On a more personal note it explores the friendship of two people who have just entered a foreign environment together and their battle of morality against desire for the prize.
