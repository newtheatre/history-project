    quote: "One of the 20th century’s most iconic theatre characters, Blanche is a daunting character to play, but Georgie Strawson was well able to rise to the challenge. Her Blanche was tender, manipulative and surprisingly funny. Impressive period costumes, solid accents and the occasional explosion of furniture made for a compelling production of this gripping and well-loved play. "
