Three Christmases. Three kitchens. Three couples. A 'tragi-comedy' focusing on the importance of an outwardly appearing happy marriage in the 1970s, conveyed through behind-the-scenes disasters at Christmas parties. A charcter based cast including a multitude of emotions but if nothing else, laughter.
