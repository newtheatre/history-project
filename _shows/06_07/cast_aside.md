    quote: "Impossible not to enjoy, whether or not the theatre world makes you shudder with delight or disgust, this one’s for you. Although thanks to some of Dave’s jokes, you may want to think twice if you’re planning to have leeks for dinner later…"

A pretentious director, moronic cast and a gender-bending, meta-theatrical mess of a production of The Merchant of Venice, merge in this satirical antidote to everything waffling, affected or ostentatious about the Stage - just what the doctor ordered, darling.

Cast Aside, by New Theatre's very own Charlie Brafman, enjoyed a sell-out run at last year's Edinburgh Fringe. They got a four star review from Three Weeks, a major Fringe review newspaper. Some proceeds from ticket sales will go towards the New Theatre Edinburgh Fringe fund.
