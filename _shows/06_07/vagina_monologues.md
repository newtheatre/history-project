    quote: "The Vagina Monologues is certainly not a bashful play; no taboos are shied away from: pubic hair to orgasms to, dare I say, the C word, are all covered. But it is not so much these issues, as the deep underlying messages of the play, a piece which speaks out against fear, shame and confusion, and ultimately is a call for the world to finally feel indignation at the vast abuses women have suffered, from rape, to domestic violence, to mutilation, and which they continue to suffer, every day."

A poignant and hilarious tour of the last frontier, the ultimate forbidden zone, The Vagina Monologues is a celebration of female sexuality in all its complexity and mystery. In this stunning phenomenon that has swept the nation, Eve Ensler gives us real women's stories of intimacy, vulnerability, and sexual self-discovery.The Vagina
Monologues has inspired a dynamic grassroots movement to stop violence against women. All proceeds from this production will go towards A
Prostitute Outreach group here in Nottingham.

Witty and irreverent, compassionate and wise, Eve Ensler's Obie Award-winning masterpiece gives voice to women's deepest fantasies and fears, guaranteeing that no one who reads it will ever look at a woman's body, or think of sex, in quite the same way again.
