    quote: "Overall, Stars in their Eyes New Theatre-style was as entertaining as the real thing â€“ a good laugh and the occasional burst of genuine talent. So, pop on down to the New Theatre until Saturday 3rd March, to check out the other acts, and support the group in their mission to take Edinburgh by storm."
