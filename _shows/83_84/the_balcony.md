  - quote: "I had to hold an air pistol for the assassin role. The director wanted to make sure I'd feel comfortable handling it, so during a rehearsal in the Trent Building he insisted on me shooting a pellet into one of the walls of the tunnel to Portland Building. It was still there when I graduated a couple of years later."
