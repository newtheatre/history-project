> "Treat us as though we were children... Nice children, of course, children that you're fond of, but not as gorwn-ups. And for God's sake, whatever you do, don't praise us - that drives us mad"

\- Arthur Shields to Frank O'Connor, his advice to O'Connor who had just been elected to the boardroom of the Abbey Theatre.

> "Were I in England now (as I once was), and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there would give a piece of silver: there would this monster make a man: any strange beast there makes a man"

\- Shakespeare ('The Tempest')

> "Personality is just consisten error."

\- Max Jacob "Ars Poetiques"
