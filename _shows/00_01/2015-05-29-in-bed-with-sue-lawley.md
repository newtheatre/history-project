Luring celebrities to a desert island is a chorus of four Sue Lawley sirens. A distinctly B-list group of celebs is washed ashore to face reality. For some it is too much: celebrity gardener Billie Puffin is convinced cameras are hidden in the coconuts; pop star Joe Devivre is desperate to know how theyâ€™ll cope without him on Blankety Blank, while actor Martin Grant is exposed as the "biggest winker" by the Big Sister chorus of immaculately coiffured Lawleys.
