Luring celebrities to a desert island is a chorus of four Sue Lawley sirens. A distinctly B-list group of celebs is washed ashore to face reality. For some it is too much: celebrity gardener Billie Puffin is convinced cameras are hidden in the coconuts; pop star Joe Devivre is desperate to know how theyâ€™ll cope without him on Blankety Blank, while actor Martin Grant is exposed as the "biggest winker" by the Big Sister chorus of immaculately coiffured Lawleys.

Promises an "unforgettable chorus of all-singing, all-dancing Sue Lawleys".
