‘Pilgrimage’ follows Max, Zed, Brook, Rory and Stevie as they navigate romance, friendship and transitioning into adulthood in the ultimate freedom of first year. Set around the University Park Campus, ‘Pilgrimage’ takes an alternative look at university and explores the benefits and dangers that the freedom afforded by moving out can have on young adults.

Written in free indirect discourse, ‘Pilgrimage’ gives an intimate insight into the minds of the characters and combines poetry and drama to explore the hedonism and challenges of first time independence.

Heart warming, dramatic and a little bit existential, ‘Pilgrimage’ is a piece that encapsulates the university experience in a very unique way.
