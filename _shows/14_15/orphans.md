Helen and her husband Danny are celebrating the news that Helen is newly pregnant with their second child with a quiet night in, but are interrupted by Helen's brother Liam, who arrives covered in blood claiming to have found a young man who has been stabbed on the street. However when Liam's account of the event begins to change under questioning, suspicions are aroused followed by increasing concern that he may have been more involved than first thought. A commentary on the extreme violence in urban areas, the question is - how far you would go for your family?
