trivia:
  - quote: As can be seen in some of the prod shots, we attempted to install a functional proscenium curtain that lowered and rose at the top of each act. Ended up getting cut during the dress run as it buckled under its own weight.

Written by one of the founding fathers of the ‘the Theatre of the Absurd’ / ‘Rhinoceros’ follows Berenger / a disenfranchised and disillusioned anti-hero / as he refuses to change whilst the rest of the characters turn into rhinoceroses. A dark / dystopian / satirical phase / ‘Rhinoceros’ is fundamentally a play about conformity and the cult of opinion. However / the play touches on many ideas / such as the meaningless of language / the ridiculousness of everyday convention and alienation. This chilling representation of humanity attacks the arrogance of our everyday moral convictions.
