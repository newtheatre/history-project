Written by one of the founding fathers of the ‘the Theatre of the Absurd’ / ‘Rhinoceros’ follows Berenger / a disenfranchised and disillusioned anti-hero / as he refuses to change whilst the rest of the characters turn into rhinoceroses. A dark / dystopian / satirical phase / ‘Rhinoceros’ is fundamentally a play about conformity and the cult of opinion. However / the play touches on many ideas / such as the meaningless of language / the ridiculousness of everyday convention and alienation. This chilling representation of humanity attacks the arrogance of our everyday moral convictions.
