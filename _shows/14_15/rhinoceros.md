Written by one of the founding fathers of the ‘the Theatre of the Absurd’, ‘Rhinoceros’ follows Berenger, a disenfranchised and disillusioned anti-hero, as he refuses to change whilst the rest of the characters turn into rhinoceroses. A dark, dystopian, satirical phase, ‘Rhinoceros’ is fundamentally a play about conformity and the cult of opinion. However, the play touches on many ideas, such as the meaningless of language, the ridiculousness of everyday convention and alienation. This chilling representation of humanity attacks the arrogance of our everyday moral convictions.
