Telos follows four students at the end of university who are all, for undisclosed reasons, in group therapy. During sessions paced with bitterness and surface tension, questions are raised as to the worth of love, parenting and what it is about graduating into the “real world” that scares them – forcing everyone to face their deep set fears.
