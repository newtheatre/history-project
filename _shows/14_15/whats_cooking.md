    quote: "What’s Cooking? is an intelligently put-together production that is highly enjoyable, but at the same time incredibly serious. It is impossible to avoid giggling at the struggles of a long term couple, alongside appreciating the good things in life which can be lost in a moment. A fresh, innovative and utterly enchanting performance."

Amidst occasional power cuts, Roger and Kate are trying to enjoy a meal. Adrianna has been left in charge again and is relishing her freedom. When Bill and Annie come in to escape the rain, Adrianna is keen to prove herself a generous and entertaining host. She makes the rules here. Over the course of the evening, wine will be served. The vintage will be finished. The truth will out. Scores will be settled.
