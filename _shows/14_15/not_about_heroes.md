Edinburgh, July 1917. At Craiglockhart War Hospital for Nervous Disorders, Siegfried Sassoon crosses paths with Wilfred Owen. The former, arrogant and frustrated, has literary fame; the latter, diffident and traumatised, is completely unknown. Under Sassoon’s tutelage, Owen creates the most revered war poetry ever written, including Anthem for Doomed Youth and Dulce et Decorum Est. Fifteen years later, after a string of affairs and spiralling into depression, Sassoon looks back on their sixteen months of passion- passion that was for both their poetry and for each other. “I don’t know where either of us will go. But I’m glad I’m here, tonight, with you.”
