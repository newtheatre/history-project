37 plays in 97 minutes. Watch as 3 actors attempt to do what they believe is “unprecedented in the history of civilization.” You’ll recognise all the characters you know and love (or hate), from Juliet to Hamlet to MacBeth. Whether or not you’re a fan of the Bard, you’re guaranteed a night of laughter and hideous wigs.
