    quote: "The highlight of the show was undoubtedly the cast’s excellently exaggerated voice work, pitched at just the right level of zany for their larger-than-life characters."

When a series of mysterious murders hits downtown Toyland, it’s up to ragdoll Inspector Carmen McGraw and teddy bear Deputy Harvey B. Feltz to get to the bottom of it once and for all. Featuring hard-boiled wise-cracks, a line-up of colourful criminals and more murder outlines than you can shake a crow bar at, The Toyland Murders is a fast-paced family-friendly toybox puppet noir adventure unlike anything the New Theatre’s seen before.
