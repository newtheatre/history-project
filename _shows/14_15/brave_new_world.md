Adapted by Roger Parsley. In Aldous Huxley’s amazing dystopian future filled with sex, drugs, and test-tube babies one man feels out of touch with his pain free life. His wanting to feel something more than society lets him have attracts unwanted attention from his superiors. When trying to impress a female co-worker he takes her to a human reservation, where those who live outside of societies rules succumb to disease and famine. There they meet a savage called John and make a shocking discovery which has far reaching ramifications back home, changing both their lives forever.
