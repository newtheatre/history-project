    quote: "Punk Rock by Simon Stephens is gloriously directed by Bridie Rollins and Lara Tyselling to create an almost flawless take on what is most certainly a complex and multi-layered play."

Combining sharp humour, ruthless violence and compassion, Simon Stephens’ Punk Rock provides an unnerving chronicle of contemporary adolescence at the breaking point. A controversial and acute production that remains scarily relevant to the present day. This performance contains smoking.
