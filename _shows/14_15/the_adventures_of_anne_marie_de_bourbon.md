    quote: "Essentially, The Adventures of Anne Marie de Bourbon isn’t really about its rather bland title character at all – it is about us. We repress the existentialist angst that Lavelle exhibits, harbor the insecurities that dog the ostensibly assured puppets; we are the actors behind that stage."

A first for the New Theatre - a musical puppet show! This cleverly comic show depicts the extraordinary adventures of Anne Marie, a French aristocrat. After stowing away on a pirate ship, Anne is taken to a mysterious island, hitherto untouched by the outside world, hidden in the Bermuda Triangle. Join Anne Marie as she tries to understand the bizarre world she has been thrust into.
