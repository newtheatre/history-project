A first for the New Theatre - a musical puppet show! This cleverly comic show depicts the extraordinary adventures of Anne Marie, a French aristocrat. After stowing away on a pirate ship, Anne is taken to a mysterious island, hitherto untouched by the outside world, hidden in the Bermuda Triangle. Join Anne Marie as she tries to understand the bizarre world she has been thrust into.
