‘The course of true love never did run smooth…’
Step into a world of glittering illusion as Lakeside reinvents William Shakespeare’s timeless romantic comedy: A Midsummer Night’s Dream. 

One of the most beautifully lyrical of the playwright’s creations, join Puck and enter into the forest to explore the realms of mischief and magic. 

Following the stories of star-crossed lovers, impish fairies and clumsy thespians, the fusion of the earthly and the enchanted ultimately results in disastrous consequences. Lakeside’s hilarious and aesthetically entrancing revival of this cherished play is accessible and entertaining for all audiences, making it a production not to be missed. 

Following two successful co-productions working in partnership with Nottingham New Theatre, Lakeside is delighted to be working in partnership with The Nottingham New Theatre, following two successful co-productions of Lysistrata and Dr Faustus.
