Kate, Anna and Deeley are three people approaching middle age, whose lives have declined in excitement and adventure. They drink, smoke and reminisce about the old times they spent together. But beneath the surface of their taut, witty conversation lurks suggestions of darkness, until the present is overwhelmed with imitations of some frightening past. ‘Old Times’ explores how memories differ from truth and the all-encompassing nature of sexual rivalry.
