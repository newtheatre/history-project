Overspill is a play set in Bromley revolving around Baron, Potts and Finch - three 20 year old mates who decide to tell the story of their usual Friday night out filled with booze, burgers, bouncers, birds and banter. However, things take an unexpected turn when a bomb explodes in McDonalds and interrupts their comfortable routine. As more explosions tear their beloved hometown apart, tensions rise in the town as a vigilante state of mind takes hold, and for the lads, who began the weekend with such bravado, things are about to come to a violent end.
