Life in St Louis, Missouri, during the Great Depression was not easy. Tom Wingfield knows this all too well as he shares his memories of that time. A young aspiring poet tethered by reality to a monotonous job in a shoe factory, Tom is obligated to financially support his mother, Amanda, and his emotionally unstable sister, Laura, after his father abandoned the family some years previously. Having spent her younger years in Blue Mountain being greeted by gentleman callers, Amanda becomes obsessed with finding Laura a husband. Driven to the edge by judgement and hopelessness, Tom must choose between the family he loves and the life he desires.
