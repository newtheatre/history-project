For two nights only, join Emily Brady (‘a beguiling comic energy’ - Beeston People) and Ben Hollands (‘pure pleasure’ – also Beeston People) in a warm and cosy room for an evening of improvised storytelling. With new stories and characters every evening and featuring a live improvised soundtrack, A Likely Story promises to amuse, delight and enchant. Cloakrooms will be provided for your cynicism and ennui.
