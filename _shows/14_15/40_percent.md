    quote: "The writing and directing of Nikki Hill is to be commended. She managed to capture the student experience in a way that brought both laughter and sadness to the audience, and allowed us to reflect upon the apparent absurdities of student life."

40% is about a group of five first year students who are forced into doing what they dread the most, a group project. They raise important questions about feminism, masculinity and attitudes towards sexuality which are both comic and thought provoking. The five strangers each bring and take away something from the group, each opening up in their own ways to prove that people aren't always what they seem.
