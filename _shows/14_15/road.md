"THIS IS OUR ROAD!" Over the course of one wild night of drunken debauchery follow our mischievous tour guide, Scullery as he takes us down his anonymous road in Lancashire where we’re introduced to "all-sorts" who inhabit this un-named town. Hilarious, magical, and at times, very uncomfortable, we are given a glimpse into the world that is “ROAD”. Set in 1986, the play explores the lives of working class citizens in northern England during the Thatcher government and how they deal with their desire to escape the hopelessness of their lives. As a theatre experience we will be creating a completely immersive, unforgettable, one-of-a-kind show like never before seen on the NT stage. "Tonight it's your road an' all."
