Liverpool, 1989. Greg is thirteen and has just started school and for some reason keeps being put in detention. Greg swears it was Tom’s fault, but he doesn’t want to upset Tom’s Dad because he’s big, he’s blue and that’s bad enough. Liverpool FC are everything to him. Greg dreams of playing for the reds, to go out onto Anfield and score one with Barnesy at the Kop end. But Greg has a story to tell you. Stories of the city he loves, the friends he’s going to have for life, the girls that keep picking on him and trip to Sheffield Wednesday that will live with him forever.
