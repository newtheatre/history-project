Cheque Please follows Ivy, a waitress, who offers the audience a chance to experience a couple of weeks inside her head. Dealing with her depression and on a spiral of self evaluation she is forced to decide, with the aid of the audience, if she too wants to collect the cheque on her life and commit suicide herself. With the help of the other characters that influence her life, they build and illuminate conversations and experiences for the audience both as an outsider and from the inside of her own mind, posing the question; is your life worth it?
