OPEN. Sharp devised theatre peering through the cracks in modern Britain. A brand new original piece set in a takeaway on election night. This play brims with bizarre characters, plucked right from the Great British public, spinning a tale of nostalgic optimism and greasy fingers. We have cobbled together stories from across Britain in an attempt to find the threads of commonality often hidden from view. If you love Russell Brand, hate Russell Brand, watch Question Time, watch Gogglebox, vote UKIP, vote Green, love this country or don’t recognise it anymore, this one’s for you.
