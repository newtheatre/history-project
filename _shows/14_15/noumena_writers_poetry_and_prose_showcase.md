Members of the Noumena Writers Collective will perform poetry and short fiction extracts from their freshly launched anthology. Travel with them to Africa, Ireland, Spain, and back in time to the distant past. Conquer your fears or fall in love. Embrace a bromance or revel in an anonymous encounter. Relive childhood memories and remember how life used to be.
