1970â€™s LA, a bombardment of lights, mystic rhythms transporting you into a world of indulgence, drugs, sex and outrage. Everything about it oozes with style. You want to hate it but it seduces you. Four characters, all entwined in a whodunit scenario. Equally glorious and despicable, who is the most likely culprit? Delve your way through the chaos and accusations, as it becomes increasingly apparent that behind the spectacle and glamour lie dangerous and damaged existences.
