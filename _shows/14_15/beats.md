In 1994 the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act effectively outlawed raves, banning public gatherings around amplified music characterised by 'the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.' Featuring a soundtrack from a live DJ and psychedelic 90s-inspired visuals, 'Beats' tells the story of Johnno McCreadie, a teenager living in the small suburban Scottish town at the time of the Act. 'Beats' is a coming of age story exploring rebellion, apathy, and the irresistible power of gathered youth.
