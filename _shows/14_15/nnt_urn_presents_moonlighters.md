Moonlighters is the University of Nottingham's resident jazz band. We perform a variety of styles, from classic big band jazz to pop arrangements and modern funk charts. We have been playing gigs and functions throughout the year and we can't wait to play our last gig of the year at the Lacehouse on the 18th! Bring your dancing shoes and get ready to listen to some of your favourite tunes! Then afterwards, stick around for a DJ set by the guys at URN!
