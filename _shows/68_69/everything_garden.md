Giles Cooper was born in 1918. His first play, 'Never Get Out', was succeeded by more than fifteen successful radio and television plays. 'Everything in the Garden' was written in 1962 and is both a comedy od situation and a satire of civilised values. In it, the lengths to which acquisitive suburbia is prepared to go to safeguarg its outward respectability are displayed in an astonishing way.
