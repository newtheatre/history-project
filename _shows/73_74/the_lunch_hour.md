A short play actually put on the lunch hour!

Lunch Hour is a 1961 film based on a one-act play by John Mortimer. It is about a man and a woman who have an affair during their lunch hour. Shirley Ann Field described it as perhaps "the most enjoyable film I'd ever done" because the cast and crew all worked so closely together.
