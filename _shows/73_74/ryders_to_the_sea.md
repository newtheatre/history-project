Synge was probably the greatest of the dramatists associated with the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. By living among the fisherman of the Arran Islands, he absorbed Irish Folklore and gave it dramatic form. 'Riders to the Sea' a "tragedy of classical simplicity" set on one such island in a time of poverty and great sorrow.
