In 1967 Joe Orton was battered to death by his lover, Kenneth Halliwell. He left behind a handful of plays and television scripts. When Sarah Kane committed suicide in 1999 she too had only lived long enough to produce a relatively small body of work - five plays in total and one short film. The violent circumstances of their authors' deaths is not the only factor that links "The Ruffian on the Stair" and "Crave". Both plays deal with the theme of death, or more specifically, the desire to no longer exist.
