It is our intention in offering "Morning on a rainy day" and "Capital" to generate thought and discussion, and not merely to court controversy. We are genuinely concerned with the theme of the circularity of human behaviour that all too often prevents us from taking a step beyond ourselves in order to fully comprehend our own misgivings and errors of judgement. Where "Morning" aims to concentrate this issue on the personal level, "Capital" seeks to extend the line of thought to a global scale.
