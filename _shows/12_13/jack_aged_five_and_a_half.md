Growing up, Ben and Jack would squabble, as brothers do. As the eldest child, Emma was always something of a referee, caught between her younger siblings, with a reluctant desire for more adult company. Looking back now, Emma reflects on her own place in the tragedy that befell her family. Jack, aged five and a half, is an exploration of childhood, growing up and all the nostalgia that comes with it.
