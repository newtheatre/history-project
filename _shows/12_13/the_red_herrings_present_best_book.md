A Writer, A Deadline, Two angry Publishers and an intense night of fully improvised comedy action. 

Improv Society is proud to present its first show of 2013 with its brand new troupe The Red Herrings, and we cordially invite you to the show in which YOU help decide the plot.

No scripts, no rules, no limits and possibly some falling over. You would be a fool to miss it!
