In an unnamed police state, a writer has been arrested because the content of his stories bares a striking resemblance to a series of gruesome child murders. Interrogated by two brutal detectives, he claims to know nothing of such murders. But also in their custody is his younger, brain damaged brother, who perhaps knows more than he first lets on. A darkly comic thriller like no other.
