    quote: "Go to see The Pillowman: it will push the boundaries of what you thought was acceptable humour, encourage you not to take anything you thought you knew about theatre for granted and challenge your mental arithmetic if you even dare to take on the challenge of counting the ‘f’ word. Expect the unexpected."

In an unnamed police state, a writer has been arrested because the content of his stories bares a striking resemblance to a series of gruesome child murders. Interrogated by two brutal detectives, he claims to know nothing of such murders. But also in their custody is his younger, brain damaged brother, who perhaps knows more than he first lets on. A darkly comic thriller like no other.
