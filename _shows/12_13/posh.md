Eight Oxford University boys, unlimited champagne, one escort and a night of debauchery and destruction. Welcome to the Riot Club. Royal Courtâ€™s play of the year 2012. Contemporary, outrageous and intelligent. Posh is the perfect combination of disturbingly relevant satire and a scandalous and savagely funny cast. Bottoms up.
