WASTED is the debut play by poet and rapper Kate Tempest. Following a critically acclaimed 42 date national tour and sold-out run at London's Roundhouse, WASTED is back on tour and heading to our very own little Nottingham New Theatre....

I’m making a decision. I’m changing things. This is it.
Three old friends. One remarkable day. For Ted, Danny and Charlotte, life will never be the same again.
A day glo trip through the parks and raves and cafes of South London, where life is what you make it. The words of Kate Tempest paint a picture of lives less ordinary in an unforgiving world, soundtracked by an exhilarating score.
A play about life, love and losing your mind.
