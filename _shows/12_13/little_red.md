    quote: "I would definitely recommend watching this alternative take on a story that many of us hold familiar. Well done to Director Eve Wersocki Morris for an intense and unique performance!"

A unique devised performance. The process began with talking about the symbolism of childhood innocence and sexual awakening within ‘Little Red Riding Hood’ – this developed into improvisations, scripting and a complete original play. The production presents the story of Alice, a modern thirteen year old girl, who strives to leave the path of childish ignorance. The modern world interweaves with the traditional fairytale creating a ghostly parallel of Alice’s experience. Be entertained by a play which harnesses an original style – including ensemble sequences, singing and stylised characterisations – and will move you and make you laugh as we discover that reality does not always guarantee happy endings.
