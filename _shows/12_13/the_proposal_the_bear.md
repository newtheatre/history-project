### The Proposal
When Ivan is heartily accepted into the family by Stepan, his hopefully soon to be father-in-law he expects the day can only get better. It only gets worse.

### The Bear
Popova just wants to mourn her husband in peace, Smirnov just wants the money Popova's husband owed him, Popova's maid just wants everyone to be happy. Hopefully without anyone getting shot. Some of these aims are achievedâ€¦
