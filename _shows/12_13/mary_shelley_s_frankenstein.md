Frankenstein follows the gradual mental and physical deterioration of Victor Frankenstein following his creation of a living being, a reanimated corpse as part of his experiment to beat death. Things spiral out of control and Victorâ€™s life is ruined. A tragic and moving piece of theatre with elements of dance, physical theatre, song, acapella, and great performances from one of the most popular cultural works of the last 200 years.
