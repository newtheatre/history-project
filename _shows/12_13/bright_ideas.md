Exams are fast approaching, and inevitably that means locking yourself away somewhere and struggling through page upon page of dense notes. But here at the Nottingham New Theatre we'd rather enjoy flicking through page upon page of quality new writing!

To that end, we have decided to organise a Bright Ideas evening at the theatre, involving your superb new writing! The night would involve as many pieces as we get submitted to us, performed by as many of you actors available during such a busy period, right here on the New Theatre stage!

We will be having a meeting a week or so before the evening to organise which actors perform which pieces, and it must be noted that the beauty of this evening two years ago was that scripts are indeed allowed on the night!
