    quote: "With some disgusting uses of food, very un-sensual uses of sex and frankly creative uses of Tom Jones, this play is one to see, and one to treasure."

A play of murderous hunger and creeping revenge. Kenneth battles against two of man’s most grave obsessions – sex and food. We follow Kenneth’s yo-yo ride between his wife, Hilary, who provides him with the most lustful meals, and his mistress, Laura, who gives him the most scrumsious sex. Three years after the divorce, Hilary invites Laura and Kenneth round for a celebratory meal. With a hungry look at Kenneth, Hilary informs her guests that the main course will be a surprise. Tonight, sweet revenge is sure to be on the menu.
