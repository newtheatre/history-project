October, 1968 - Three Oxford physicists enjoy their quite comfortable academic lives. But when they are told that NASA is about to lose the Space Race, they are embroiled in a plot to deceive the world. Or are they? MOON is a play that explores truth, knowledge, secrets and lies, and how we survive in a world we can never fully understand.
