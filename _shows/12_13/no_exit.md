Three strangers are locked in a room together. This room is hell but instead of shackles, racks and fire there are only words, unwanted affection and troublesome pasts. By the end of this one act play, Garcin, Inez and Estelle are inseparable, however they all come to the same conclusion; hell is definitely other people!
