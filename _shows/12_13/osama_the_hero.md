    quote: "It is an entirely different type of theatre experience, and raises thought-provoking questions about the War on Terror and post 9/11 Britain. Although it cannot be described as an ‘enjoyable’ night out at the theatre (or garage), it is certainly not one to be missed."

Gary isn’t a terrorist; At least, not yet. Four of his neighbours don’t think so and he finds himself strapped to a chair and given an ultimatum “I want you to nod that you did it. If you don’t Mark’s going to smash you in the teeth with this hammer. D’you understand?” A completely gripping, gruesome and utterly hilarious examination of post 9/11 Britain, you will find yourselves locked in the dark and subjected to some of Dennis Kelly's (After the End, Orphans and most recently Utopia on channel 4) most thought provoking work. Who are the 'terrorists'? And more importantly, does it really matter?
