    quote: "Yes, this production had only two weeks to prepare, and they did a jolly good job, but sadly missed the level of excellence expected of even ‘two-weekers’ at Nottingham’s student theatre."

Stitch is looking to gain some direction in his life by visiting his sister and exploring the very exciting gay scene of Hull. What results is an obsessive crush on a man that works in the local aquarium and Stitch stealing a baby penguin. Brilliantly funny, emotionally moving, ‘Me, As Penguin’ is a unique, witty and northern comedy.
