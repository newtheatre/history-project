A co-production between Fine Frenzy Theatre and The Nottingham New Theatre
Two sets of twins. One town. No idea.
The first performances of Shakespeare's plays happened after only a couple of days of rehearsal. The result was raw, precarious and no-doubt thrilling as Shakespeare's words found their first life in front of an audience.
Now, with a box of kid's toys, 14 superb actors and 48 hours to rehearse, Fine Frenzy Theatre attempt to rediscover that same immediacy with Shakespeare's shortest, funniest, most downright insane play.
Things could go horribly wrong.
Or they could go horribly, horribly right...
