    quote: "Jerusalem is everything a student production should be: raw talent, entertaining and unsettling. All the right elements are there; the elusive ‘fairy’ provides the perfect hook, and the genuine hilarity is complemented with intellectual undertones. The performance never bores nor patronises."

Join infamous scumbag Johnny Rooster Byron and a host of other outcasts as they fight back against their local village council. It’s the day of the annual village fete and Johnny’s just been evicted from his dilapidated caravan in the middle of the woods. Vivid characters. Fast-paced, anarchic dialogue. A woodland set complete with a real smashed up caravan. What’s not to love?!

This show was selected to represent the Nottingham New Theatre at the National Student Drama Festival in 2013.
