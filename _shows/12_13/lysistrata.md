Ever had trouble sleeping?

From the mind of one of Britain's greatest contemporary playwrights comes the tale of seven elderly people and their bed. Minds bursting at the seams with the most terrifying memories and the most wonderful dreams, getting some shuteye in this place in not going to be easy.
