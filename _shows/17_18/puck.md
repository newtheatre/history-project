Puck, from Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', appears in the 21st Century and continues her mischievous love-potion brewing in this audience-interaction show. When a boy appears who loves to speak in poetry, the nostalgic hero finds she is torn between concocting her troublesome spells and becoming a victim of the love flower herself.
