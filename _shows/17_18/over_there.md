    quote: "For a play that is brash and flashy in many regards, its beauty lies in the subtle way that it builds emotion and tension between the twins.It's that emotion that explodes into the shocking end."

When Franz’s mother escaped to the West with one of her identical twin boys, she left the other behind. Now, 15 years later, Karl crosses the border in search of his other half. As history takes an unexpected turn, the brothers must struggle to reconnect.

Mark Ravenhill’s duologue is sharp, quick, explosive and does not let the audience catch their breath for a moment. Exploring the true essence of brotherhood and the effect political events can have on these relationships, ‘Over There’ forces an entire sector of society to come to terms with their culture, language and history being wiped away- to pick up the pieces of what is left behind and move on into an unrecognisable future.
