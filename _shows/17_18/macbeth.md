Three witches approach two nobles late at night, their faces mangled and their motives unclear. They foretell great fortune for Macbeth, great fortune that leads, ultimately, to downfall.

One of Shakespeareâ€™s greatest tragedies, Macbeth deals with many themes: from the fight between free will and fate to the psychological breakdown caused by murder and betrayal. The characters of this play struggle for power, might and for their lives, as the forces of fate and greed propel them to extreme action. A poetic masterpiece, this show offers some of the most famous and interesting characters in theatrical history.
