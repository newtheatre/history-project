    quote: "A moving yet equally unsettling play, The Effect takes you through a series of intense emotions forcing you to look at the state of humanity and your own mental state. The cohesion of set, lighting and sound along with the talent of the cast and crew served to create this gripping and thoroughly impressive production."

A clinical romance. Two young volunteers take part in a pharmaceutical drugs trial testing the effects of an antidepressant.
During the trial they fall madly in love with one another – but are their feelings for each other genuine, or are they experiencing the effects of a drug labelled a Viagra for the heart. ‘The Effect’ is a funny, moving play exploring questions of sanity, neurology and the limits of medicine, asking what makes us who we are and how we love.
