    quote: "The sixth collaboration between Lakeside Arts and Nottingham New Theatre presents a hilarious take on Alan Sommerstein’s translation of Lysistrata. The play incorporated singing, dancing, water pistols and even plastic penises, that kept the audience laughing from start to finish."

The ancient world is gripped by a seemingly interminable war. With the men of Athens serving in the forces, the women of the city can take no more. In secret they meet with the enemy women and form a pact. The battle moves into the bedroom. No sex for the men unless the women get peace. First performed in 411 BC, this bawdy anti-war play remains one of the great comedies. Layered with themes of feminism, power and politics, we’re thrilled to present this contemporary adaptation in our sixth partnership with Nottingham New Theatre.
