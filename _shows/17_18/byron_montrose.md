Blackadder meets Milton Jones. Pun filled comedy story telling with breaks for bad poetry. The sellout Edinburgh Fringe show returns to Nottingham New Theatre after touring the UK. Byron Montrose is disinherited, exiled and just can’t quit the opium. Hear his adventures as he drifts around Europe in search of love, lust and laudanum. “Full of cheek and charm” Sabotage reviews “like a Spike Milligan book ... delightfully different.”  Notts comedy review.  It’s silly witty and just a little bit naughty.
