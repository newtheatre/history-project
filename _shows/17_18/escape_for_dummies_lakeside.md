  - quote: For the original run we were going to have this whole bit with a cage on wheels, until we worked out it wouldn't fit in the van. But for the Lakeside performance we didn't need a van, so we added it back in. It went wrong both nights.

    quote: "Very very funny. Brilliantly acted and a brilliantly novel script, and when there is no script as such, just noises, bringing out that comedy through physical theatre makes this comedy all the more special."

Dummy F’s routine consists of standing aloft a shop podium, pickpocketing customers and fruitlessly attempting to escape retail prison... 

Until the day arrives when her dreary existence is toppled by the unboxing of Dummy M in the men’s section. He takes his position seriously and will not be distracted by such foolishness. But swift as a no nonsense check-out worker, an unspoken bond unique as the bar code attached to their clothes blossoms amidst the hustle and bustle of the shop, and together they hatch a plan to escape the drudgery of the store. Beyond the watchful gaze of bumbling security guards, maniacal watch dogs and a sinister floor manager, this is a story of two mannequins with love in their fiberglass hearts and freedom in their sculpted heads!
