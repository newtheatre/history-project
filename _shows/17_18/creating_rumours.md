Creating Rumours recounts the lives of Fleetwood Mac at the time of the recording of their most notorious album, Rumours. This unofficial work focuses on the bandâ€™s battle to stay together and finish the album despite all the personal struggles and heartache they were dealing with at the time. Each member of the band and their producer Ken talk to you about the sound, the songs and the tension. This is the making of music history. This is the making of Fleetwood Mac. 

'An engaging, intimate and thoughtful production. 8/10. Excellent, highly enjoyable' (Impact Magazine).
