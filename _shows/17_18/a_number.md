“I’m just a copy. I’m not the real one.” When thirty-five year old Bernard discovers that there are several cloned versions of him, his relationship with his father, Salter, becomes dangerously uncertain. The situation becomes worse when Salter’s original son arrives and the huge web of deceit that has been created begins to be torn down. Caryl Churchill’s haunting two hander examines the ethics of science with a new spin on the father/son relationship. A Number opens a debate about nature vs. nurture in a time when science is pushing the boundaries of what society can handle. When your identity is no longer just your own, how will you cope? This production is presented by Coronet Productions in association with the Nottingham New Theatre.
