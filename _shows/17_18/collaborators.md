    quote: "Imagine \"Blackadder\", \"Monty Python\", a smidgen of \"Benny Hill\", \"The Young Ones\" and you'll get the idea of the style of comedy. At times anarchic, but always a lorra lorra laffs."

Moscow, 1938. A dangerous place to have a sense of humour; even more so a sense of freedom. Mikhail Bulgakov, living among dissidents, stalked by secret police, has both. And then he's offered a poisoned chalice: a commission to write a play about Stalin to celebrate his sixtieth birthday - but Bulgakov’s not the one who’s going to end up writing it…

A darkly comic satire of Stalinist Russia, winner of the 2012 Olivier Award for Best Play, and inspired by historical fact, John Hodge’s Collaborators embarks on a surreal journey into the fevered imagination of the writer as he loses himself in a macabre and disturbingly funny relationship with the omnipotent subject of his drama.
