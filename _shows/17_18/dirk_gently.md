    quote: "With Dirk Gently associated with its slapstick comedy and humour, it is evident that the play did not disappoint. Every pun, clumsy fall, and nerdy joke was awarded outbursts of laughter from the audience, outbursts so loud that sometimes actors lines could not be heard for a short while."

“Thank you for asking; the term “holistic” refers to my belief in the fundamental interconnectedness of
all things.”

When Richard’s boss Gordon is shockingly murdered he is thrust into the bizarre and fast-paced world of Dirk Gently – his old room-mate from university who now works as a holistic detective. Dirk takes it upon himself to help Richard by finding the murderer using his unique detective techniques. What Richard doesn’t realise is that accepting Dirk’s service will lead to the uncovering of a long-kept secret of Cambridge’s resident Professor of Chronology and an attempt to help an alien from the beginning of time.

This play, based on the hit novel by Douglas Adams, is a whirlwind sci-fi epic encapsulating comedy, heartfelt moments and the fate of all humanity.
