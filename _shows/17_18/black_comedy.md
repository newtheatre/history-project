    quote: "Farce is all about comedy timing and this cast have obviously worked hard on this. The laughs come thick and fast, and not just giggles or chuckles, proper belly laughs. It is great to see comedy written in the 1960's getting such a brilliant reaction from the students."

In one hilarious act, the action supposedly in the dark is illuminated; when the lights are to be on, the stage is dark. Lovesick and desperate, sculptor Brindsley Miller has embellished his apartment with furniture and object d’arte (that are not his) to impress his fiancee’s pompous and stern father, and a wealthy art dealer, George Bamberger. The fussy neighbour, Harold Gorringe returns, whom Brindsley has stolen all the furniture from, just as the blown fuse plunges the apartment into darkness and Brindsley is revealed to be teetering on the verge of very ripe farce. Unexpected former/current lovers, ageing spinsters, errant phone cords and other snares impede his frantic attempts to return the purloined items before light is restored.
