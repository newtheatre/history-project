    quote: "Because of that, the evolution of Adrian and Alice’s relationship felt unnaturally quick, and therefore the moments of strong emotion felt unearned. The actors were working hard and going well with what they had, but they often seemed as if they were fighting against the script."

It’s New Year in Rotterdam, and Alice has finally plucked up the courage to email her parents and tell them she’s gay. But before she can hit send, her ‘girlfriend’ reveals that he has always identified as a man and now wants to start living as one. As Fiona/Adrian starts his journey, Alice must also figure out how she fits into this new life. Can a lesbian really be in love with a man? And when the changes which Adrian has longed for start coming too fast for Alice, their relationship becomes strained.
