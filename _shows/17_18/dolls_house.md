    quote: "An extremely controversial decision, Nora opts for the life of a ‘human being above anything else’, and leaves the audience reflecting on how conventional morality has impacted what humans consider to be responsibilities of everyday life."

In this timeless study of the domestic setting and the sacrificial role of women, we see a relationship crumble under the pressure of debt, expectations set by society and integrity. Henrik Ibsen’s classic is brought to life again by Simon Stephens, in this refreshing reminder of the need for honesty and spiritual liberation. Will the cracks in the Helmer’s marriage heal or do they already run too deep?

‘You are a wife and a mother. Before anything else.’ ‘I think I’m a human being before anything else. I don’t care what people say. I don’t care what people write in books. I need to think for myself.’
