This uncharacteristically wholesome play by Philip Ridley shows two young people who deal with ruptured families and homelessness by embracing their hopes and fears in a derelict community centre. Kirsty has run away from her 15th birthday party and found solace in the nearby abandoned community centre. As she enters and calms down by adding to a mysterious mural that has appeared over the last few weeks she is confronted by Gideon, an eccentric boy who is the one responsible for the mural. After a brief back and forth they open up to each other and, using Gideonâ€™s make believe world of Karamazoo, begin to address their problems together, helping each other see their lives in a different light.
