    quote: "This is part of the University's Fringe Season and we often think that \"Fringe\" means alternative. Not so in this case as this is one piece of theatre that is a lovely, gentle piece of theatre for all age groups leading to thought provoking discussion periods."

This uncharacteristically wholesome play by Philip Ridley shows two young people who deal with ruptured families and homelessness by embracing their hopes and fears in a derelict community centre. Kirsty has run away from her 15th birthday party and found solace in the nearby abandoned community centre. As she enters and calms down by adding to a mysterious mural that has appeared over the last few weeks she is confronted by Gideon, an eccentric boy who is the one responsible for the mural. After a brief back and forth they open up to each other and, using Gideonâ€™s make believe world of Karamazoo, begin to address their problems together, helping each other see their lives in a different light.
