    quote: "I noted that one male student in front of me was affected by this story, and you can't have a greater accolade bestowed upon a cast and crew than evoking some emotion from your audience by a piece of art created with talent and love. Both evident in \"Replay\""

“I know how hard it is to forgive someone you love more than anything for leaving” ​…
When a fiercely independent, workaholic police officer finds herself on the street where her brother
once lived, she is propelled back to her vibrant childhood and forced to confront a tremendous loss.
Intimate, moving and ultimately uplifting, ‘Replay’ by Nicola Wren is the story of a woman revisiting
her childhood.

Combining acting and shadow puppetry, this new monologue explores through heart, honesty and humour what it means to grow up, accept loss, be vulnerable and celebrate the past, however painful.
