This semi-devised piece is about Satan, the person who decides how people pay for their sins on Earth once they have departed from the human life. Satan believes that humanity is silly, ungrateful beings that do not understand how lucky they are to be alive in the world they have. Satan is also bored with their job and finally snaps after receiving a letter from Heaven that deems their work in adequate. This pushes Satan to take a day off and travel to the human world to observe Godâ€™s creations to see if their opinion of humanity is correct.
