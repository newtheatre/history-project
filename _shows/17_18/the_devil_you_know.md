If ghost stories aren’t true, then where do they begin?
Maybe we believe in monsters because our own demons are too much to bare?
When a malevolent force corrupts a small town, three friends begin to question their loyalties and exactly how far you’ll go for friendship. Charlie, Lex and Q have always been friends but maybe it’s true what they say, “threes a crowd”. They should have listened to their parents and stayed well away from the woods.
“The Devil You Know” is a spine-chilling horror that will keep you on the edge of your seats. This dark thriller explores the intensity of young friendships, relationships and experiences with the unknown.
