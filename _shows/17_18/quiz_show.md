It is perfectly healthy to suppress memories. False! Eventually suppressed memories can cause debilitating psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, or dissociative disorders. Did you know that? 2017 was the year for Fake News, how good are you at calling out lies? Come and see a live recording of our Quiz Show, False!, where three contestants test their knowledge of what is real to get to go through the door of truth! They say ignorance is bliss but for one of the three contestants, only the truth will set them free.
