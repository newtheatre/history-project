    quote: "The language has an old feel but there's a lot of modern comedy flashes of inspiration, often breaking the fourth wall with a cheeky glance or a wink in this piratical romp."

 Loosely based on *The Tempest*, this show is an absurd political satire chronicling two days in the lives of six pirates, and one dead parrot, shipwrecked on a tropical island. These buffoonish buccaneers turn on one another, each vying for power, using different ideologies to manipulate their comrades. This fast-paced comedy explores whether institutions can ever be anything but systems for oppression and whether game theory is an accurate description of political practice.
