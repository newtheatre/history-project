There is a man who reads minds and predicts the future. How he does this remains a mystery to most. His explanation is bizarre, but is it all lies and trickery? Or is it stranger than you could possibly imagine? Returning to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe after two successful previous years, director and multi award-winning magician Joe Strickland presents a show that uniquely blends magic with storytelling. 

‘Fresh, imaginative and thought provoking’ (Scotsman). 

'Triumphant proof of the creative potential of magic and theatre combined' \*\*\*\* (FringeGuru.com). 

'Pure Fringe, a hugely enjoyable 50 minutes' (TheWeeReview.com).
