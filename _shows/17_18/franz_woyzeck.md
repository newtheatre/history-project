  quote: "A good piece of theatre will evoke some kind of emotion from the audience and that is certainly true of this play. You could see the climax coming but even though you were expecting it, it still came as a smack in the face."

War has now been raging for many years; peace is as good as forgotten, soldiers have become a part of everyday life and death is more visible than ever. But now Franz is home, with his loving wife Marie, and both are as safe as they can be. So why is it that he cannot seem to relax around anyone, or trust anybody? Why can he barely look his baby daughter in the eye, or even acknowledge her existence? Will Franz and Marie ever be able to be truly happy again? Loosely based on Georg Buchnerâ€™s incomplete 19th century German classic Woyzeck, this modern adaptation focuses on remembering victims of war, and questioning how it is we remember them, exploring this through physical theatre.
