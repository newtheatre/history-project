“You hear stories, you just want to find out, I guess.”
Captivated by local folklore, four friends endeavour to uncover the horror that haunts their local woods. But their dreams of discovering the truth soon take a dark turn when one of them disappears. Terrorised by the unknown, the remaining trio use paranormal methods to communicate with the seemly demonic forces haunting the woods, resulting in disastrous effects. Because, when the hunters become the hunted, there’s more to fear than just the dark.
