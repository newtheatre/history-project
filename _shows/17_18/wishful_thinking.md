In a land Far Far Away lived a few washed up fairy tale characters enslaved by "Evil" and her stepdaughters. 
With the help from a few interesting personalities along the way, they embark on their magical quest for love, freedom and a good ol' boogie! With a bit of wishful thinking what could possibly go wrong....

Wishful Thinking is a devised panto by NNT's UnScripted troupe. All ticket profits will be donated to the theatre's season charity, CoppaFeel.
