  quote: "As something that does not take itself too seriously, it is a witty, light-hearted 80-minute show that will certainly leave you with at least one well-timed, well-written gag that you can use in your own conversations, about philosophy, the nature of mastery, or Morrissey being a prick."

  quote: "This trio created a witty piece of theatre which also shows that the references within the script were well researched and worked into the flow of the script."

Set against the backdrop of Major’s Britain and in a very real sense, against the backdrop of their own studio apartment, two dashing wastrels - caught on the fringes of grunge and sense - pursue a lifelong dream they’ve had for at least a week: winning a Battle of the Bands, producing the seminal 1990s album, and getting invited onto Top of the Pops. Along the way our plucky Brit-Pop duo must overcome the seemingly insurmountable hurdles of a rival band that’s much better than them, and the weight of cursed knowledge supplied by a Daemon of utmost power and cunning. Does fame have a price? Can you be a successful musician if you can’t play? Does a deal with the devil ever end well?
