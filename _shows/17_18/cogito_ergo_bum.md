Set against the backdrop of Major’s Britain and in a very real sense, against the backdrop of their own studio apartment, two dashing wastrels - caught on the fringes of grunge and sense - pursue a lifelong dream they’ve had for at least a week: winning a Battle of the Bands, producing the seminal 1990s album, and getting invited onto Top of the Pops. Along the way our plucky Brit-Pop duo must overcome the seemingly insurmountable hurdles of a rival band that’s much better than them, and the weight of cursed knowledge supplied by a Daemon of utmost power and cunning. Does fame have a price? Can you be a successful musician if you can’t play? Does a deal with the devil ever end well?
