Never-seen-before… Never-to-be-seen again! UoN Improv present “…And Another Thing!” - a completely improvised one act play.

What’s the one thing you’ve always wished you told somebody? What was the perfect phrase for that perfect moment that just passed you by? What was that one thing that left you wondering “what might have been?”… Well wonder no longer - for five nights, our incredible team of improvisers will be giving YOU the chance to find out what the world would be if you’d bitten the bullet and just said what you felt! 

Different every night and inspired by an audience suggestion, our actors will create an entire one act play on the spot - no scripts, no preplanning; just 8 performers, a stage, and that one thing you wish you’d said! Expect love and loss, heartbreak and hilarity, a cavalcade of characters and spinning subplots all made up entirely for you on the night, never to be performed again! So what are you waiting for? Come see what you missed out on…
