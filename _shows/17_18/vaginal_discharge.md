  quote: "In my opinion, this is a play that everybody needs to go and see. It’s educational but not condescending, breaching topics that are still seen as taboo today in a way that is both accessible and inclusive."

  quote: "The four, all female cast set out to educate the male majority audience tonight, and I found myself being educated in an entertaining way, not unlike Eve Ensler's ground breaking \"Vagina Monologues\". You really do leave the theatre a little wiser than when you went in."

‘Say all the words. Say all of them. Never concede. If you’re going to do something, do it 100%. Say the words. Vaginal discharge. Vaginal discharge. Vaginal discharge. Say them. Used tampon. A used tampon. Mooncup. Menstrual blood, periods. I’ve decided that these things are just words.’ Four people. Three women, one man. Three people with vaginas, one without. Four separate ways of living. 

A new short on what happens when family routines and rituals collide with the orbits of individual humans. This is a play in search of an ending that will never find one.
