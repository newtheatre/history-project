    quote: "I've seen some amazing productions at NNT and this is way up there. I love new plays that I've neither seen nor heard of and it excites me that NNT feed my hunger for plays like this, and at the same time do it so well."

Billy has tormented his daughters, Susan and Janet, and wife, Mary, for the past three decades. Now, Billy is dead and the three women must try to discover how to recover from years of abuse. Through a series of monologues and interviews, we slowly see the extent of the abuse and how it has affected them, as well as how the world turned its back on them for so many years. Mary, Susan and Janet slowly learn how to overcome the demons that Billy has left them. 5 Kinds of Silence examines how a family is affected by the horror of abuse, and how it can change each and every member of that family for the rest of their lives.
