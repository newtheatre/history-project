    title: "\"Salome\" by Oscar Wilde"
    date: 2018-05-03
    quote: "Having read many of Wilde's plays, and being a fan of his wit, this play is a nice change from the comedy in his other plays, and I was so pleased that NNT decided to choose this one to perform, plus it's another one ticked off the list of plays I'd not seen before."

In a play originally banned in Victorian England for its unbridled presentation of female sexuality, when the young princess Salomé first sees John the Baptist she is enthralled. A servant to her stepfather, the all-powerful Tetrarch Herod, she must endure his persistent attraction, to discover the power she has over those who desire her. Set against the backdrop of the tumultuous Judea in the aftermath of the rising of Christ, Salomé by Oscar Wilde is a tantalising exploration of morality, sexuality and the consequences of wanting what you can never have. How deadly can it be?
