Inspired by their current production of Phil Porter's Blink, Squabbling House Theatre are delighted to present the company’s first collection of new writing shorts: SCRATCH.

Funny, dark ... potentially entertaining. This is your chance to see SCRATCH before it goes to Edinburgh in August so why not come and share your thoughts?
