Working Class Hero is one of the two shows the NNT is taking to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer.

A father and his son. A son and his father.  Ten snapshots over one hundred days. Football, politics, John Lennon, education, Akala, humility.  How do we cope with losing the things we love?  What if we know it’s for a good reason?  What if we know it isn’t?  During his first semester at university, a son realises that his father is a person just like the rest of us.  A person who makes mistakes.  A person who struggles.  A person who dreams of a better life and a better world for him and his son.  Working Class Hero is a story of understanding and discovery, and of growing up with the belief that we are all special.
