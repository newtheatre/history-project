    quote: "The play is staged in a very inventive manner, making full use of the New Theatreâ€™s intimate interior to confront the audience with the potency of the symbols and themes that it presents. A particularly effective technique is the live musical accompaniment to the performance, which subtly adds to the suspense and emotion of the piece without imposing itself upon the cast."
