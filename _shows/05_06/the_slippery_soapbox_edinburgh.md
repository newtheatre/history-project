    quote: "The best show of the fringe '06. The Slippery Soapbox is absolutely hilarious, the writing is brilliant - filled with some of the most genius lines I've ever heard. The cast are all immensely talented, each one playing their parts perfectly. It has it's own unique style which means no matter how many times you see it, it never stops being funny."

    quote: "The cast introduced the strangeness at lightning speed, each scene lasting just a couple of minutes before the audience was propelled to another even more bizarre situation. Sketch shows can be difficult to pull off, but the energy and enthusiasm of the actors ensured that we giggled our way through an hour long journey into the absurd."
