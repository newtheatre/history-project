    quote: "A considerable achievement... It causes considerable laughter,..played with the carefree batting chuckle-fest comedy needs. Each of the young cast gives it their all, and lucky them, the play gives them characters you can believe in... a real treat!"

    quote: "Cast Aside was a delight. [...] There’s only so much ‘dark’ and ‘deep’ (why do directors love these words?) theatre that you can deal with, so Cast Aside, with its light-hearted but incredibly quick and witty script, was a perfect alternative."
