    quote: "For both its execution and its topicality, Persae attracted a great deal of positive critical attention from major publications The Stage, Three Weeks, The Scotsman and The Independent who referred to the play as “…The darkest and most incendiary politics on the fringe.” Theatre may be an ancient medium, but Persae proved that in the Information Age its message still pierces the clamour with deadly accuracy."
