    quote: "Over its month long run, ‘Warehouse 364’ regularly attracted double the audience of the average Fringe performance, and deservedly so. However, McNamee’s talent for translating filmic concepts to the theatrical stage was not fully realised this time, as his action packed script suffered under the pressure of time constraints."

An amalgam of razor sharp-witted new writing and devising, Warehouse 362 is delves into the murky waters of part-time prostitution (Tuesdays and Thursdays, not bank holidays). With a generous helping of Film Noir gangland underworlds, mysterious strangers and, of course, a warehouse (a big one), Warehouse 364 is rich, vibrant and at times downright trippy. Starring a prostitute.
