    quote: "A scholarly examination of feminism this is not, but a mirthless and satirical scrutiny it certainly is. Let’s hope feminism can take a joke."

Thirty years ago Margot Mason, pioneer of the 1970’s Women’s liberation movement, wrote her groundbreaking work, “The Cerebral Vagina.”

As she sits in her country house struggling to finish her new book a student, Molly Rivers, enters, handcuffs her to a desk, and pulls out a gun…

A brilliant comedy juggling the ideas of feminism in a highly satirical and farcical manner.
