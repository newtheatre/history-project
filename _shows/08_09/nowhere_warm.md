    quote: "However for a person who finds hospital dramas depressing and morbid, I was impressed ‘Nowhere Warm’ was a moving exploration of grief, relationships and the preciousness of the life. The directors and cast have made a terrific effort to pull together a fantastic play. They all must be proud of themselves."
