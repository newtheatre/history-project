    quote: "A very well delivered exploration of the human condition at it’s most raw, “Someone Who’ll Watch Over Me”, though quite a lengthy play, is most certainly worth watching. You are advised to book quickly as the performance is set to be (deservedly) very popular!"

An Englishman, Irishman and American are sitting in a cell in Lebanon. They have no idea why they’re there or who has captured them. They have no idea how long they’ll be there for. They have no idea if they’re going home, ever. Someone Who’ll Watch Over Me is a topical, darkly humorous play revolving around the trials and tribulations of three hostages trying to maintain their sanity in the face of loss and uncertainty. A testament to the essence of human resilience and laddish camaraderie.
