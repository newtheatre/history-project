  quote: "'Offending the Audience' was a very brave attempt to do something different. The cast was a particularly confident one; they seemed to be competent actors despite the lack of acting that took place. The director Frank Wolfgang Hellmann was particularly talented in making his audience uncomfortable, running up and down the steps shouting and fixing his victims with an enigmatic stare."
