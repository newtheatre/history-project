    quote: "That said, Sonabendâ€™s mix of buffoonery and drama, with an little bit of pathos thrown in for good measure mixed quite well, to form a satisfying piece of work from the first sip to the last."

Set in a dingy bar in 1950s Chicago, The Sieve Never Leaks follows the adventures of Solly the Sieve; criminal informer, alcoholic and idiot. Happy with the quiet life and a bottle of whiskey, things go wrong for Solly when he attempts to blackmail a local reporter. The reporter, unaware she is being blackmailed, publishes an article claiming Solly has information which could bring down some of the most powerful men in the city, resulting in murder attempts, bribes and even long lost love, in this rags to riches and inevitably back to rags tale.
