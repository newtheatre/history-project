    quote: "If you enjoy mocking television talent shows and want to see some very witty acts, this is a must see performance! It runs from Thursday 19th February until Saturday 21st February. Keep your eyes out for Britney Spears and the Vengaboys!"

New Theatre's annual lolathon. Famous director Tony Lau has gathered together a bunch of talentless wannabes for your viewing pleasure.

Multifarious expressions of performance art will be on display and it is up to you the audience to decide whether to vote with your pity card or talent card.
