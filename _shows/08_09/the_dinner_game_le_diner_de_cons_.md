Every week Peter Brook and his mates invite the biggest idiots they can find to a dinner party so they can make fun of them. This week, Peter has invited Bernard, a tax man who loves to build and talk about his match-stick models in his spare time. But Peter never imagined that such a fool could do so much damage...

The Dinner Game, is a student translation and adaptation of the French play "Le DÃ®ner de Cons" by Francis Veber.
