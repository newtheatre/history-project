A combination of characters inspired by Fyodor Dostoevsky’s 'Demons' and David Foster Wallace’s 'Infinite Jest' share a performance space in which they can discuss a common concern: depression and addiction. The central medium by which to discuss is held in the character of The Doctor / Tikhon, a modern-day psychiatrist and 19th-century monk respectively. By offlaying their suppressed introspective ideas on highly personal topics; onto an authority figure, Katie and Nikolai both are attempting to navigate the complexities of their histories and deeply complicated psychological issues. The play does not proffer up a solution, only a platform to discuss.
