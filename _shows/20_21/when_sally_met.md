Everyone’s heard of the classic love story, When Harry Met Sally, but in 2020 it feels a bit outdated. How do we find our soulmate nowadays? Tinder. Obviously. Unbelievably bored at the start of lockdown, dating-app skeptic Sally finally installs it. ‘It works for some people!’ The voice of her best friend, Chrissy, rings in her ears. She gives it a go… How bad can it be, right? She’s not expecting, or hoping, for love at first swipe. That was true until she matched with the fateful serial-dater Harry.
