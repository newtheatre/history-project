Breakneck breakbeat drums are the beating heart of a 1990s university campus where ideas about the future are accelerating. Sadie and Mason find themselves in the middle of it all. The pair cannot resolve their differences about what their futures are but soon reality becomes unstuck and time gets out of joint. With tensions rising between the two Mason struggles to remember what has happened between them.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92263860/145695476-a08611c9-d423-4162-b5bc-1c85bfe2fb1b.png)
