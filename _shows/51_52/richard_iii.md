  - quote: "Rosemary England had characters make use of the entire Great Hall, abseiling from the circle down to the stalls and run onto the stage ... We were meant to march up the centre aisle, then round to the aisle Left and down to the Stage ... I suddenly noticed I was being followed by only two characters; three others were calmly marching towards the Left aisle. I had to do something. \'My Lord of Hastings! Has\'t forgot the way to the Tower? This is by far the shorter route.\' And I marched on...all the characters now behind me. Members of the audience howled with laughter and cheered the impromptu addition to the play."
