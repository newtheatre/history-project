A unique visual and musical interpretation of Roald Dahl’s classic tale of Charlie Bucket’s adventure into the weird and wacky world of Willy Wonka’s chocolate-making factory.
﻿
The sold-out and critically acclaimed production was performed by a cast of 16 students from Nottingham’s award-winning ‘New Theatre’ society, together with a live band playing an original score composed by the company.
