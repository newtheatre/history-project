    quote: "[T]hese stories, all founded in the feet and the shoes which adorn them, are tied together well by their metaphorical shoelaces and are told by skilled performers who present a bunch of dynamic characters in energised performances"

The Shoe Story is an original and contemporary piece of theatre for families and young audiences structured as a triptych of cautionary stories all with one thing in common: shoes! The three tales involve a naughty boy who can’t tie his own shoe laces and ends up in a big knot; an evil queen with the world’s largest collection of shoes who refuses to share her wealth; and finally the little birdie-boy, born with the feet of a bird who struggles to find a pair of shoes to fit him.
