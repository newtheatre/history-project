Part of the Archaeology and Classics building left up when building was demolished.
Properly converted into a studio space in 2013, white to black walls, blue carpet to
vinyl floor, rig and drapes installed.

Studio A, with its slightly larger size and installed dimming is the main performace space for our Fringe season in the New Theatre building. However, many fringe shows explore other venues both on and off of University Park Campus
