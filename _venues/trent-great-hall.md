First opened in 1928, Trent Great Hall has been used by the university for many official functions. It has been used as a lecture hall, with special lectures having been given by both Mahatma Gandhi and Albert Einstein. However, nowadays, it is mainly used by societies for performances and other events.

The space has a large proscenium arch stage at the western end and balconies that run along the two longer sides.
