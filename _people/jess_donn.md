I started working at the theatre in my first year of University in 2015 by, mostly, shadowing every role I could. However, I didn't start getting fully involved until my adopted theatre mum Darcey (adopted because I didn't do Freshers' Fringe and only did backstage roles) sent me a message to the effect of "you might be interested in running for committee". With her encouragement, I ran for Workshop Manager and was elected to the 16-17 committee. I was also lucky enough to be invited up to Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2016 with an external company made mostly of NNT members, Strickland Productions, a company I went on to work with for 3 Edinburgh runs.

In my time as Workshop Manager, I was responsible for helping to run the weekly get ins and get outs for both the In House and Fringe seasons, particularly regarding the set design/construction. As well as this, I helped to maintain the workshop equipment and train the membership in its usage.

However, the main project that I undertook this year on committee was Unscripted. As committee, we decided we wanted to extend the role of the previously named drama club which ran an un-auditioned project to be a full devising troupe writing and performing our own scripts. I offered to take it on thinking that it would be a chill weekly session with a few other people. Cut to the winter holidays where we were writing a script for 17 actors with a 6 strong creative team of directors and writers. *Camp Macbeth* was an incredibly strong start to Unscripted's lifespan and the ticket sales directly contributed to NNTs season charity. I'm so proud of running *Camp Macbeth* and *Potential* (the summer term Unscripted show) for the people it brought into the theatre as their first chance as a project and for what it then did for the NNT. Unscripted is making its way to being a third season alongside with In House and Fringe and has an entire committee position to help run it!

In my third year, I got involved with as many shows in as many different roles as I could, including a run of 5 different shows in 5 different roles in 5 weeks. Third year also saw my first (and only real) acting credit as the 9 year old child in *A Doll's House*. Finally, being 5ft HAD helped me out, even if I did corpse my way through every single show. I also got the opportunity to produce *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency*, a show that I thought about or worked on for just under a year and saw me on a production team with one of closest friends. *Dirk* was a purposefully silly time and I loved literally every second of working on it.

I couldn't quite let Uni and NNT go and so in my MSc year I worked on numerous more shows including directing *Adult Child/Dead Child* and producing *The Seagull* (a show which, again, I worked on with an incredibly close friend for a very long time - it was a bit of a white whale for us and I was happy to have finally conquered it). Alongside this, I was also In House Coordinator, managing 16 productions across both the Autumn and Spring semester seasons. Within this role I also produced the second NNT 72 in 72 initiative of *Twelfth Night*. I also finally took a show to Edinburgh Festival Fringe with the NNT itself, producing *Franz and Marie: Woyzeck Retold*.

NNT has given me so much joy to be a part of for 4 years, and I'm incredibly grateful for all of the skills I was able to develop, all of the projects I got to complete, and all of the friends I made along the way. It's a very special building and a very special community and I sincerely thank everyone who made my time at NNT possible. Here's to everything that is to come.

(Oh and in my final In House show I was a plant in a scripted role and I didn't corpse. It all gets better, folks.)
