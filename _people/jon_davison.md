I accidentally found my vocation here. A housemate dragged me along to the dramsoc beginning-of-year party on the promise of free wine. I signed up to audition for a non-speaking role and ended up with a lead role.

Eventually found clowning and performed all over the world, set up clown schools in Barcelona and London and wrote two books on it.
