As Snug, the joiner, in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', I had only three lines: "Yes", "No", and a four line speech. In the four line speech on the last night I remembered the first two lines but the last two I had to make up because I'd forgotten them completely. FANCY making up Shakespeare!! But no one noticed except the Producer.

My daughter, Julia, came with my wife Celia, to watch West Side Story and at the end she said to Ce "He wasn't bad, was he" which was praise indeed if you know my daughter, who has just been appointed as a Headteacher of a Primary School.

I got my Degree from Uni. of Nottingham after I'd officially retired, but still Teaching on Supply and Tutoring privately. At present I am eighty four and still loving life.
I take several organizations to historic and archaeological sites.
Before getting the Degree, I was a Telegram Boy, a Navigating Officer Cadet in the Merchant Navy on Tankers, did National Service as a Teleprinter Operator in the Royal Air Force, had several office jobs, and ended up going to Teachers' Training College to enable me to teach Primary School Children
