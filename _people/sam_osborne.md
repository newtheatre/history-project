I joined the NNT in my first year, and never looked back. I met so many marvelous people, who helped me realise that physics absolutely was not for me. So, in my third year, I started English. And met some more fabulous people. I had the best time, and got the opportunity to do so many amazing things: making websites, crewing, producing, and even a one-time directing stint in first slot Fringe. It always came back to tech, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
