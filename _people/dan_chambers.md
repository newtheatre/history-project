Since graduating, Chambers has worked with New Theatre friends Nick Ostler and Mark Huckerby to create 'The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers!', inspired from a New Theatre 1993 sketch show. The cartoon has seen international success since 2002 when it was picked up by Pesky Ltd. 

It features three brothers, Xan, Adi and Enk, who are from Rendoosia and take part in death-defying stunts in every episode with their catchphrase "Yahzaa!". 'The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers!' won the Best Children's Animation BAFTA in 2006.
