In DEAD the Musical I ran onstage a chorus early and had to do the entire dance routine alone before leaving in great shame (and fits of laughter).



I am currently on the Mercury Theatre Writer's Programme 2023-2024. I wrote and performed in a dark comedy titled 'Flumps' last year at both the Barons Court London and a number of Fringe venues. I was a co-writer and starred in a webseries which can be found on YouTube called 'Mags: When It Rains' and I am currently working on my first short film script titled 'Road To The Rainbow'. I have representation as an actor and am hoping to gain writing representation.
