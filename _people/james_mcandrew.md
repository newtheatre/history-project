I had the pleasure of being involved with the theatre for just over 4 years, spending most of my time Directing, as well as the odd bit of 'acting' and 2 years on the Committee. My proudest moment was, as Fringe Coordinator (2013-14), overseeing an unprecedented amount of new, student-written plays produced at the theatre; with 8 new plays and 1 new musical staged over the course of the year. A more personal highlight was transferring Jim Cartwright's 'Bed' (my first attempt at Directing), to Lakeside's Djanogly Theatre, with a bit of help from Nick Stevenson. Undoubtedly, my favourite memory is when Nick S, Nick B, Chelsea, Ben, Andy, Ginny and I played get-in Mafia, by candlelight, on-stage, in the middle of the night with the Pirates of the Caribbean 3 soundtrack playing at full blast through the speakers. Fond memories all around heartily chuckles.

After Nottingham I trained in Theatre Directing at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts and began a career as a freelance Director. So far I've managed to end up working with fellow NNT alums each time, firstly assisting Gus Miller on a new play in London (2014), then staging a new musical wit Kat Tye, Tom Hicks and Nick Stevenson at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe (2015).
