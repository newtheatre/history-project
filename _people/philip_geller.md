I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Nottingham New Theatre. My highlight was probably co-ordinating the 4 shows we took one year to NSDF. Since graduating I have production managed two shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. I now work as a Maths teacher in Manchester, but might return to theatre in the future!
