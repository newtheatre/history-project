So many fond memories. I worked at the New Theatre for two years, completing two shows as director and one as lead performer. The most impressive thing about the space I thought was the workshop. Compared to some professional spaces in London, it was extremely well resourced, and felt very much like a proper theatre. I had the opportunity to direct my first play with a fantastically enthusiastic set of students, who were new to theatre, to sell out audiences (nearly!). We roped in lots of friends to help out on a very ambitious production, but it was an easy ask given the vibrancy and energy the space provided.

Kurban has recently produced the feature film The Party staring Kristen Scott-Thomas and Timothy Spall and The Hungry for Amazon Studios.

In 2016, Kurban produced the world's first interactive feature film LATE SHIFT and co-produced THE PASS, with Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral producer Duncan Kenworthy. For Pulse Films, he worked on Sundance awards winners WHO IS DAYANI CRISTAL? and 20,000 DAYS ON EARTH and THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS, which premiered at SXSW 2014. Prior to this, he was an associate producer GINGER & ROSA with renowned filmmaker Sally Potter.

Kurban graduated from the National Film and Television School, where he won the Christie Award for outstanding contribution. He is currently on Inside Pictures 2017.
