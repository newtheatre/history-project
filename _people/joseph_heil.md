In my fist year I learned what it means to be "Blanched", was stopped outside of Coates and asked to help build set for Innocent Infidelity, stayed up to 2am far too many times and left a semi permanent impression in the tech box seats for too much operating... not much has changed 4 years later :)

I work as a casual technician at Lakeside Arts Centre and Nottingham Concert Hall, in addition to carefully 'burn' carbon fibres continuing my PhD research. I still spend every weekend in the Theatre.
