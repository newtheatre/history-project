Every moment in-between the six back to back auditions to being part of a production staged at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival! I wish I had got involved from the first year as there were such amazing people I met through the theatre. 

I've moved to London and started working in the word of IT and business. On the side, I've done a short course in Meisner Acting, as well as singing and song writing lessons. Moving to London there is no shortage of musical gigs and talent and I've been inspired to develop my musical and acting creativity.
