Being part of Dramsoc was really an extension of my love of performance at primary school and Manchester Grammar School (I'd been "showing off" since the age of seven!). 

As Crispin Harris once remarked - "Oh, John?  He's just a great big "ham"!"

During my time as Treasurer I was obviously working with every production team, (producers, directors, cast and crew), helping them to buy the materials they needed and organising advance ticket sales and each performance's box office on the door.



Unlike several of us from the so-called "Golden Years" of Dramsoc I have not pursued a professional performance career, but I have kept up at amateur level. 

As a financial accountant I have worked closely with the Arts Council for the last thirty five years and in an earlier career I was in charge of finance and grant funding at North West Arts for six years after finishing my audit, accountancy and consultancy training with Deloitte.
