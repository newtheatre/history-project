Getting involved with NNT was without a doubt the best decision I made at University. Being involved in such a rich and diverse number of shows in a number of different capacities allowed me to gain experience to pursue Technical Theatre after Uni.

My year on committee was the best year of my life so far. I made a number of lifelong friends and was involved with some of the best shows I've ever been a part of.

Since graduating I've not been fully able to shake off NNT, and from time to time you'll still find me back in the building fixing something or just being around and helpful.
