Largely through a busy medical career and family life, I've done minimal acting since. I directed The Yorkshire Mystery Plays in a church production in the 1980s and [was] lighting designer at the Birmingham Crescent ('Camille' and 'When We We Married') in the late 1980s.

Outside theatre, I specialised in psychiatry, trained in Nottingham then the West Midlands, before West Yorkshire where I still live, having retired. Ive taken an Arts & Humanities degree with the Open University. I'm a part-time volunteer and trustee at Yorkshire MESMAC, and so linked to West Yorkshire Queer Stories, an LGBTQ+ oral history project that has inspired some powerful art, as well as producing an enduring online archive of interviews.
