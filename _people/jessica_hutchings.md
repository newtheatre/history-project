The New Theatre was a fantastic place to get involved with all aspects of theatre. I'd formerly only performed, and I had the chance to learn about the technical side of things as well. I've gone on to direct since and I use a lot of the skills I learned here.

MA music at Bangor, still performing and getting involved in productions in Norwich.
