Having spent two years on committee and working on quite a number of shows it could be guessed I enjoyed my time at the New Theatre! During my time I oversaw investments made in the technical equipment of the theatre and worked on two shows taken to NSDF. Along with others from the NNT I've spent the last few summers working as venue crew at the Edinburgh fringe, and having taken a year out I'm returning to Nottingham to undertake a Masters in Computer Science.
