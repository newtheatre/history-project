The first night that all the theatre students got together we drank many shots of Aftershock and held a drumming session using rubbish bins and drumsticks outside the theatre. 

After watching a production of 'Endgame', I was both scared s**tless and turned on to Beckett. The post-show Q&A with a Beckett expert was weirdly horrifying because the man holding court looked like Jim Carrey's 'The Grinch'.

Making 'The Sideshow' with this group holds a special place in my heart because it set the tone for my playwriting career as I've almost always worked with international artists or worked remotely from the US when making theatre. Even though it's been 15 years, I still remember most of my opening monologue, a lot of the movements on stage, and can 'see' my fellow actors on stage while I was waiting for my next scene. I am planning to restage it sometime in the near future since I still have the script.

I graduated from Binghamton University with a BS in Anthropology. I moved to Shanghai, taught English and drama, and started a theatre company and, later, a production company that has had work produced on three continents to date. My plays have been published and translated into three languages. I have taught theatre workshops in several countries, studied at the Actors Studio Drama School, have earned an M.Ed. in IB Education, and am working towards my MFA in Stage and Screenwriting from the New Hampshire Institute of Art. I currently teach IB Theatre at UWC Dilijan College in Armenia.
