I owe so much to The Nottingham New Theatre. It gave me the opportunity to meet and work with so many wonderful theatre makers and helped improve my own abilities to no end. I joined in 2011 with the hope of maybe getting some acting opportunities and left having publicised, sound designed, written and directed. Since I couldn't pick a bloody lane I also worked with the Improv Society and held the position of Drama Editor at University Radio Nottingham for two years.
