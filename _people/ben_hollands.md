I owe a great deal of my university experience to The Nottingham New Theatre. It gave me the opportunity to meet and work with countless wonderful theatre makers and helped improve my own abilities invaluably. I joined in 2011 with the hope of getting some acting opportunities and left as a publicity and sound designer, writer and director (and actor, I should add).

As well as working with the theatre, I also worked with some of the other dramatic societies around the university, most notably the Improv Society, and held the position of Drama Editor at University Radio Nottingham for two years.

Currently my first writing and directing endeavour conceived in my final term has been chosen to perform at NSDF 2016.
