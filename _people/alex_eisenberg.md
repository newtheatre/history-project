I went on to do a Masters in Contemporary Performance at Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. Following that in 2007 I founded the company Present Attempt with whom I made performance, video and site specific performances which toured nationally. Between 2010 and 2013 I was the director of Showtime, a performance and theatre festival in London. I have worked in a number of artistic collaborations throughout my career and continue to make performance and video work as an artist, director and performer. Between 2012 and 2019 I worked as a curator and creative director at Live Art Development Agency in London.
