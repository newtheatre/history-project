Too many to list!

Hiring a forest of trees for The Country set and causing a ladybird infestation in the theatre or the dry stone wall we built for The Winterling or the actual Nissan Bluebird we bought and took apart for the Bluebird set!

Lots of late nights at get ins and just being constantly surrounded by incredible ambition and creativity!

I was a freelance theatre director from 2011-2015. In that time I worked for the Nottingham Playhouse, Colchester Mercury Theatre, Oxford Playhouse, Stoke New Vic, Hull Truck, The Finborough and Trafalgar Studios. I was resident assistant at The Lyceum in Edinburgh for 2 years and worked for The Traverse and A Play, A Pie and a Pint as well.

I then went into teaching and am now Head of Literacy for the Twyford Trust in West London, which includes line managing the Drama dept!
