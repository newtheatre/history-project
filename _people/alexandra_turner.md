Primary school teacher. Married another Nottingham student and had two children. Still involved in amateur performing arts, usually as performer, but often as MD, director, committee member: brass bands, church choirs, operas, musicals, vocal groups and cabarets. Hugely enthusiastic about performing arts in my school!
