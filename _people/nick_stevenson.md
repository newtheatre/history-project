I have very fond memories of my time at the Nottingham New Theatre. I produced five shows at NNT, and the highlight of my first year was taking our production of Bed by Jim Cartwright to the Djanogly Theatre at Nottingham Lakeside Arts for a week-long run. I also thoroughly enjoyed my time as Treasurer, and was proud to take on the role of President during a time of huge change for the theatre and the redevelopment of the building. Since graduating I spent a year working at Nottingham Lakeside Arts as their Arts Administration Intern, and I have now moved back to Lancashire. I am the Associate Producer for JB Shorts in Manchester, an evening of six 15 minute plays by top TV writers, and Producer of RopeWalk Productions, a musical theatre company set up along with other NNT Alumni. I am currently working on projects with my sister and theatre director Liz Stevenson, also an NNT alumnus.
