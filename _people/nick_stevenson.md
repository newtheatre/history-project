I have very fond memories of my time at The Nottingham New Theatre and thoroughly enjoyed producing the five shows I worked on during my time as a student. Since graduating I spent a year working at Nottingham Lakeside Arts as their Arts Administration Intern and produced a show at this year's Edinburgh Festival Fringe. I am now working in the North West as a freelance Producer.
