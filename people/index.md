## Alumni Biographies

We are starting to collect a set of alumni biographies to be displayed here on the alumni website. Having so many alumni who are now well-established in the industry, and we are hoping to help the current students to bridge the gap between the world of student productions and that of professional theatre.

We've prepared three example profiles for you to look at:

<ul class="bio-previews">

  <li>
    <a href="/people/philip_geller">
      {% image person_headshot people/phil_geller.jpg alt="Phil's headshot" %}
      <h6>Phil Geller</h6>
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/people/will_pimblett">
      {% image person_headshot people/will_pimblett.jpg alt="Will's headshot" %}
      <h6>Will Pimblett</h6>
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/people/nick_stevenson">
      {% image person_headshot people/nick_stevenson.jpg alt="Nick's headshot" %}
      <h6>Nick Stevenson</h6>
    </a>
  </li>

</ul>

If you would be interested in publishing an alumni bio on the website then please get in touch via <{{ site.email }}> or by [filling out a form online](/collect/person/). We are keen to publish bios for all alumni who are interested, irrespective of whether you are currently working in theatre or not.
