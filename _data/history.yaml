  title: Earliest 'New Theatre' Record
  description: "While not called the 'New Theatre', this is the earliest record of student theatre in Nottingham. At this time, members of the University of Nottingham Technical Committee were responsible for the technical areas of the student theatre."

- year: 1980s
  title: Disbandment, and the Nottingham Theatre Group
  description: |
    While Dramsoc was disbanded, all was not lost for theatre at Nottingham. The Nottingham Theatre Group (while not receiving any financial support from the Students' Union) was formed to present an annual revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

    These shows were developed and previewed in New Theatre. NTG would typically rent a venue in Edinburgh and fit it out as a temporary theatre, sub-letting the space and equipment to other Fringe groups such as Durham Student Theatre or Bristol Revunions.

- year: 1988
  title: New Theatre shut for safety reasons
  description: |
    The New Theatre had been shut down for safety reasons. It had been operating as a theatre but had no theatre licence and no emergency lighting and possibly other issues. Although the theatre was run by students, it was owned by the University. It took a year of negotiating to get the University to part with enough money to get the theatre open again.  They installed emergency lighting and it was agreed that we did not need a theatre licence on the proviso that we did not advertise productions off-campus. Only students and staff of Nottingham University were allowed to buy tickets.
 
    From Autumn 1988 to Autumn 1989 productions took part in other parts of the university. The theatre opened again in Autumn 1990.
