    While Dramsoc was disbanded, all was not lost for theatre at Nottingham. The Nottingham Theatre Group (while not receiving any financial support from the Students' Union) was formed to present an annual revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

    These shows were developed and previewed in New Theatre. NTG would typically rent a venue in Edinburgh and fit it out as a temporary theatre, sub-letting the space and equipment to other Fringe groups such as Durham Student Theatre or Bristol Revunions.
