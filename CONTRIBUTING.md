# CONTRIBUTING

## Reporting Issues

When telling us about missing or incorrect information try and include a source even if it is yourself. For reporting problems with the site be sure to include the URL and a screenshot if possible.

GitHub has a [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) on how to use their issue tracker.

## Making edits

Feel free to propose edits via pull requests. Please ensure your commit messages are descriptive though!

> "Updated cast list with information from Billy Bloggs alum (97)"

> "Added crew members from photo of programme"

> "Added poster sent in by John Smith (03)"

These are super helpful in case of conflicts of information. For example if we get some new information which conflicts with what's already on the site we can tell how credible the original source was.

## Anything else

See the [site docs](http://history.newtheatre.org.uk/docs/) and [contributing](http://history.newtheatre.org.uk/contributing/) page for more.

If you get stuck, or want to help out another way, send us an email at <alumni@newtheatre.org.uk> or get in touch with any of the [editors](https://github.com/orgs/newtheatre/people).
