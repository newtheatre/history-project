# CONTRIBUTING

## Reporting Issues

When telling us about things missing from shows, try and include a source even if it is yourself.

For reporting problems with the site be sure to include the URL and a screenshot if possible.

## Making edits

Feel free to propose edits via pull requests. Please ensure your commit messages are descriptive though!

> "Updated cast list with information from Billy Bloggs alum (97)"

> "Added poster sent in by John Smith (03)"

These are super helpful in case of conflicts of information.
