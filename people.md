## Alumni Biographies

We would really like to start collecting a set of alumni biographies to be displayed here on the alumni website. We have so many alumni who are now well-established in the industry, and we are hoping to help the current students to bridge the gap between the world of student productions and that of professional theatre.

If you would be interested in publishing an alumni bio on the website then please get in touch via <{{ site.email }}> or by [filling out a form online](/collect/person/). We are keen to publish bios for all alumni who are interested, irrespective of whether you are currently working in theatre or not. We would be looking to publish the following details:

- Name
- Year of Graduation
- Interests/roles while at the New Theatre
- Current Job/Industry Placement
- Drama School Attended (Where applicable)
- Any advice for current students
- Contact Details (ONLY if you are willing to be contacted by current students)

We are looking forward to publishing the first alumni profiles in the near future.
