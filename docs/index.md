The aim of the backend of this site to to strike a balance between making a powerful site and making that site easy to edit. For the bits that aren't that easy here's the documentation!

Pages, layouts and styling is all kept in plain text stored in a [Git](http://git-scm.com) repository hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/newtheatre/history-project). The [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) static site generator - which runs on every change as part of the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) service - then turns the consituient parts of the project into the built site in front of you.
