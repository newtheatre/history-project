# {{ page.title }}

This project relies on contributions from the alumni community. If you see a show missing information, a committee record a few names short or just have an interesting story to tell you can help out in a number of ways.

## Contacting us

Please email us at {{site.email}} if you have something to contribute, and don’t worry if you aren’t quite ready to part with your cherished New Theatre relics just yet – the University Archives have offered to photgraph and document any items sent to them, and then return them safely to you for safe keeping!
