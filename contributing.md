This project relies on contributions from the alumni community. If you see a show missing information, a committee record a few names short or just have an interesting story to tell you can help out in a number of ways.

We use Git and GitHub to both collaborate on and serve this website.

1. Create a report on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/newtheatre/history-project/issues). We use a GitHub issue tracker for both design and content changes to the site.

2. If you're technically inclined create a [pull request](https://github.com/newtheatre/history-project/compare) on our repository.

3. If all else fails, email us!
